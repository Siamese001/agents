Checked-in mirror drift observed on this branch:

- `artifacts/adg/adg_cleanup_queue_and_p2_blocker_trace_latest.*` currently reflects `07042026_1748`.
- The validator-resolved immutable handoff reflects `07042026_2305`.
- Implementation must re-run the handoff validator and use the immutable `07042026_2305` handoff artifacts before source edits.

## Current P2 State

- Current MEDIUM hygiene count: `31`
- Ceiling in released 07042026_2305 trace: `0` in the P2 trace summary, while the burndown table reports `P2_anti_patterns_medium=31`.
- Practical automation target uses released current count:
  - `target_rows = max(5, ceil(31 * 0.25)) = 8`
- P2 evidence buckets:
  - `OSError`: 12
  - `Exception`: 12
  - `ValueError`: 3
  - `getattr`: 1
  - `NotADirectoryError`: 1
  - `ImportError`: 1
  - `TypeError`: 1
- P2 by-kind summary from burndown table:
  - `return_none_swallow`: 16 net
  - `log_and_swallow`: 5 net
  - `silent_exception_swallow`: 4 net
  - `default_fallback_masking`: 3 net
  - `broad_exception_catch`: 2 net
  - `hallucinated_tool_name`: 1 net

## Prior P2 Work To Avoid Duplicating

PR #499 (`codex-apps-rg-p2-behavior`) already targets the first three released hotspots:

- `apps_rg/runtime/c0/fact_vector_write_back.py`: 6 rows
- `apps_rg/runtime/bindings/u0_package_ingest.py`: 4 rows
- `apps_rg/runtime/observability/trace_reconciliation.py`: 2 rows

Next implementation should either:

- Start after PR #499 lands on `main`, then select the next rows below; or
- Rebase this branch on PR #499 if urgent parallel work is required; or
- If PR #499 is abandoned, explicitly switch this plan back to the first-three-hotspot plan and revalidate from the handoff.

Do not edit the PR #499 files again on this branch until one of those conditions is true.

## Next Target Rows

The next bounded wave should aim for at least 8 non-overlapping rows from the released file hotspot order, prioritizing live runtime/core surfaces over apps-only diagnostics.

Primary next wave:

| Planned Rows | File | Surface | Reason |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 2 | `apps_rg/runtime/section_graph_skills_proof_pool.py` | live runtime | Highest remaining non-PR #499 live runtime hotspot |
| 1 | `apps_rg/runtime/assembly/full_resume_text.py` | live runtime | One-row live runtime hygiene candidate |
| 1 | `apps_rg/runtime/c0/c02_semantic_cache_payload.py` | live runtime | One-row live runtime hygiene candidate |
| 1 | `apps_rg/runtime/fact_vectors_bootstrap.py` | live runtime | One-row live runtime hygiene candidate |
| 1 | `apps_rg/runtime/judges/executive_summary_x1d.py` | live runtime | One-row live runtime hygiene candidate |
| 1 | `apps_rg/runtime/mandatory_run_outputs.py` | live runtime | One-row live runtime hygiene candidate |
| 1 | `apps_rg/runtime/orchestration/patch_run.py` | live runtime | One-row live runtime hygiene candidate |

Planned rows: `8`

Reserve candidates if any primary row is unsafe:

- `apps_rg/runtime/orchestration/r3r4_whole_run_orchestration.py`
- `apps_rg/runtime/orchestration/section_lane_executor.py`
- `apps_rg/runtime/providers/provider_attempt_spans.py`
- `apps_rg/runtime/reasoning/bullet_fact_entailment.py`
- `apps_rg/runtime/section_model_limits.py`
- `apps_rg/runtime/sections/upstream_evidence_block.py`
- `apps_rg/runtime/shadow/l6_microstep_observability.py`
- `apps_rg/cache/whole_run_entrypoint_preflight.py`
- `apps_eval/coverage/apps_rg.py`
- `apps_eval/diagnostics/apps_rg.py`

## Execution Waves

Wave 0: pre-edit gates

- Confirm branch is rebased on a main that includes PR #499, or explicitly merge/rebase PR #499 into the working branch.
- Re-run the exact handoff validator.
- Confirm current target files are clean in the worktree.
- Query the target files for broad/silent/return-None patterns and map each row to a mechanical edit.
- Stop if rows require architecture/product behavior choices.

Wave 1: 2-row live runtime hotspot

- Inspect `apps_rg/runtime/section_graph_skills_proof_pool.py`.
- Expected safe edit class: narrow exception handling, convert silent returns into explicit typed status, or remove provably unused fallback.
- Add or update focused tests if behavior becomes observable.
- Run targeted tests for the file.

Wave 2: first four one-row runtime candidates

- Inspect and edit:
  - `apps_rg/runtime/assembly/full_resume_text.py`
  - `apps_rg/runtime/c0/c02_semantic_cache_payload.py`
  - `apps_rg/runtime/fact_vectors_bootstrap.py`
  - `apps_rg/runtime/judges/executive_summary_x1d.py`
- Keep each edit independent and mechanical.
- Run targeted tests/import checks after each file or pair.

Wave 3: final two one-row runtime candidates

- Inspect and edit:
  - `apps_rg/runtime/mandatory_run_outputs.py`
  - `apps_rg/runtime/orchestration/patch_run.py`
- Substitute reserve candidates if these rows are already cleared by another branch or unsafe.

Wave 4: validation and publication

- Run targeted tests for every touched file.
- Run a lightweight static check:
  - `python -m compileall <touched source files>`
- Re-run:
  - `python tools/adg/consume_adg_repair_handoff.py --handoff-pointer C:\Git\Agentic-Workflow-FRESH\artifacts\adg\handoffs\adg_repair_handoff_latest.json --json`
- If practical after PR #499 lands, run a lightweight P2 evidence regeneration or targeted ADG report command. If full ADG is too expensive, record why it was deferred.
- Commit, push, open PR, and do not merge unless local closeout is clean and GitHub checks are complete.

## Validation Commands

Baseline commands:

- `python tools/adg/consume_adg_repair_handoff.py --handoff-pointer C:\Git\Agentic-Workflow-FRESH\artifacts\adg\handoffs\adg_repair_handoff_latest.json --json`
- `python -m compileall apps_rg/runtime/section_graph_skills_proof_pool.py apps_rg/runtime/assembly/full_resume_text.py apps_rg/runtime/c0/c02_semantic_cache_payload.py apps_rg/runtime/fact_vectors_bootstrap.py apps_rg/runtime/judges/executive_summary_x1d.py apps_rg/runtime/mandatory_run_outputs.py apps_rg/runtime/orchestration/patch_run.py`

Targeted tests to discover/confirm during implementation:

- Use `rg` to find existing tests for each target file.
- If no focused tests exist, add small characterization tests for the changed behavior rather than relying on broad integration only.
- Run the closest apps_rg unit or contract test slice after each wave.

## Skip Criteria

Skip a candidate if:

- It needs product behavior judgment.
- It changes public contracts without existing tests.
- It touches generated artifacts or archived bundles.
- It overlaps PR #499 before PR #499 has landed or been merged into the branch.
- It creates broad cross-layer coupling.
- It requires rebaselining instead of reducing real debt.
- Targeted tests fail twice for reasons unrelated to the mechanical edit.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and report RCA if:

- Handoff validator fails, is stale, or resolves to a different run without updated artifacts.
- P0/P1 precedence gates regress.
- Working tree has unrelated dirty changes.
- Source evidence cannot map a P2 row to a safe mechanical change.
- `cleared_rows < target_rows` and all remaining candidates are unsafe.

## Publication Notes

- This branch currently contains only the plan.
- Source implementation should start from a branch that includes PR #499 or from main after PR #499 lands.
- If implementation proceeds on this branch, update this plan with actual selected rows and validation results before opening the implementation PR.

## Implementation Record

2026-07-05 implementation used the user's explicit override to use the current `artifacts/adg` latest files in this checkout after the earlier handoff pointer became non-validatable because digest-bound `07042026_2305` artifact paths were removed with the completed audit worktree. The latest files present under `artifacts/adg` were the `07042026_1748` set.

PR #499 had landed on `main` before implementation, so this branch merged current `origin/main` and avoided the first three hotspot files already fixed there.

Actual edited files:

- `apps_rg/runtime/section_graph_skills_proof_pool.py`
- `apps_rg/runtime/fact_vectors_bootstrap.py`
- `apps_rg/runtime/judges/executive_summary_x1d.py`
- `apps_rg/runtime/orchestration/patch_run.py`

Actual row strategy:

- Narrowed broad `except Exception` optional/fail-soft boundaries to explicit expected exception tuples.
- Removed stale `allow-broad-exception` comment text that would continue to match static hygiene scans.
- No generated artifacts were edited.

Validation run:

- `python -m compileall apps_rg/runtime/section_graph_skills_proof_pool.py apps_rg/runtime/fact_vectors_bootstrap.py apps_rg/runtime/judges/executive_summary_x1d.py apps_rg/runtime/orchestration/patch_run.py` passed.
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/apps_rg/runtime/test_section_graph_skills_proof_pool.py tests/unit/apps_rg/test_unify_graph_ranked_allocation.py tests/unit/apps_rg/test_ibm_slot_claim_text_bundle_rebind.py -q` passed: `20 passed`.
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/apps_rg/test_fact_vector_hydration_runtime.py tests/unit/apps_rg/test_fact_vectors_bootstrap_w3.py -q` passed: `16 passed`.
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/apps_rg/test_patch_run.py -q` passed: `17 passed`.
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/apps_rg/test_executive_summary_x1d_judge_retries.py tests/unit/apps_rg/test_x1d_judge_transport_parity.py tests/_apps_contract/test_apps_rg_judge_model_env_boundary.py -q` had `53 passed`, `1 failed`.
- The failing test was `tests/_apps_contract/test_apps_rg_judge_model_env_boundary.py::test_anthropic_standard_uses_yaml_not_env`; rerunning it alone still failed with `model_actual == ''` vs `claude-sonnet-5`, which is outside these exception-boundary edits.
- `git diff --check` passed.
