# Agentic Core — Multi-Provider Judge Panel Harness

**North star:** Generic spine infrastructure so any `apps_*` proof panel grades **one canonical judge contract** (stable digest) through **N provider adapters** with **transport parity receipts**, **provider-neutral pass math**, and **app-supplied gate-closure reconcile maps** — preventing “same packet, three different effective rules.”

**Problem this solves:** `apps_rg` built a parallel X1D stack (`run_llm_judges` + hand-rolled `_call_gemini` / `_call_openai` / `_call_anthropic`) outside `agentic_core/runtime/judges/llm_judge_gateway.py`. Core has single-judge gateway, judge jury (candidate selection), Exit-eval HTTP judges, and **reasoning** transport parity (`transport_capabilities` + `reasoning_control_resolver`) — but **no** multi-provider panel harness. That gap allowed transport and objective drift (Brown & Brown Claude-only soft-fail while X2 all PASS).

**Anti-pattern (forbidden):** Moving `apps_rg` rubrics, X2 gate definitions, or executive-summary copy into `agentic_core`. Core owns **orchestration law**; apps own **content and closure maps**.

**Related (coordinate, do not duplicate):**
- [`exec-summary-x1d-transport-parity-d8f2a1.md`](exec-summary-x1d-transport-parity-d8f2a1.md) — **apps_rg remediation** (rubric/packet/reconcile/transport in place). Ship or complete W1–W2 there **before** apps_rg migrates onto core harness (W3 here).
- [`exec-summary-operator-ship-a3f7c2.md`](exec-summary-operator-ship-a3f7c2.md) — CERTIFIED / 3/3 operator semantics.
- [`apps-rg-v40-spine-gap-c4a8f1.md`](apps-rg-v40-spine-gap-c4a8f1.md) — judges migrate to apps; core keeps gateway (this plan defines the gateway shape).

## Context (SCQA)

- **Situation** — `agentic_core` provides `LLMJudgeGateway` (one profile → one provider), `JudgeJuryRunner` (score candidates), L3 `BaseHttpJudge` (Exit dimensions), and reasoning transport receipts. `apps_rg` owns X1D semantic quality via `executive_summary_x1d.run_llm_judges` and section policies requiring Gemini + OpenAI + Claude on proof sections.
- **Complication** — Without a core panel harness, each app reimplements fan-out, pass math, JSON locks, token budgets, and reconcile policy. `apps_rg` drifted: identical user packet, divergent system/transport, conflicting rubric vs X2 gates. Local test harness (`x1d_judge_transport_contract.py`) audits source after the fact; nothing enforces parity at runtime in core.
- **Question** — How do we add **generic** infrastructure so multi-provider judge panels cannot silently apply different rules?
- **Answer** — Introduce `agentic_core/runtime/judges/panel/` with **CanonicalJudgeContract**, **JudgePanelRunner**, **JudgeProviderAdapter** protocol, **TransportParityAuditor**, **ScoreNormalizationLaw**, and **GateClosureReconcileEngine** (algorithm in core, map in app). Migrate `apps_rg` adapters behind the protocol after apps remediation plan stabilizes contracts.

---

## Architecture Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|----|-----------|
| INV-1 | Core panel harness is **app-agnostic**: no `apps_rg` / `apps_lic` literals, gate IDs, or rubric prose in `agentic_core`. |
| INV-2 | Apps supply: rendered contract bytes, `deterministic_gate_summary`, gate-closure map profile ref, provider registry keys. |
| INV-3 | **One** `judge_contract_hash` per grading invocation; every provider request receipt logs it. |
| INV-4 | **One** rendered user payload per hash; providers may not mutate objectives in transport layer. |
| INV-5 | Transport adapters differ only in HTTP/API mechanics (schema placement, `json_object`, `responseSchema`, etc.). |
| INV-6 | **ScoreNormalizationLaw** in core is the only authority for `pass` / `decisive_failure` from parsed JSON. |
| INV-7 | **GateClosureReconcileEngine** may suppress findings only via app map + passed gate evidence; never blanket FAIL→PASS. |
| INV-8 | Transport failure (truncation, parse error after bounded retry) → `BLOCKED` / `INCONCLUSIVE`, not content FAIL/PASS. |
| INV-9 | `UNKNOWN` is never PASS; mocked/stub paths cannot satisfy proof-required panel slots without explicit flag. |
| INV-10 | Existing `llm_judge_gateway` remains for single-judge profile flows; panel harness is additive, not a breaking replace in W1. |
| INV-11 | Boundary migration receipt required before merge (`artifacts/governance/migration_receipts/`). |
| INV-12 | Author-Gate approval required at W0 (core addition). |

---

## Product Decisions (lock W0)

| ID | Decision |
|----|----------|
| PD-1 | New package path: `agentic_core/runtime/judges/panel/` (not `evaluation/judges/` — runtime orchestration SSOT). |
| PD-2 | Reuse **pattern** from `reasoning_control_resolver` + `TransportCapabilities` for judge transport receipts (new types, no coupling to SovereignLLMGateway). |
| PD-3 | `JudgeProviderAdapter` registered by **provider_key** string; apps register implementations at startup or via entrypoint factory. |
| PD-4 | Gate-closure map loaded from app profile (YAML/JSON/Python) validated by core schema; exec summary map stays in `apps_rg`. |
| PD-5 | **W2 migration** of `apps_rg` is optional until `exec-summary-x1d-transport-parity-d8f2a1` W1–W2 green; harness ships with core tests + fake adapters first. |
| PD-6 | Deprecate `inspect.getsource` transport audits in apps over time; replace with core preflight API + contract tests. |
| PD-7 | Second consumer (`apps_lic` or research) is **W4 optional** — only if product needs same 3-provider proof panel. |

## Core Module Map (target)

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| `canonical_contract.py` | Immutable contract artifact, stable digest, validation |
| `adapter_protocol.py` | `JudgeProviderAdapter` — build request, parse response, declare capabilities |
| `panel_runner.py` | Fan-out, shared prompt/hash, bounded retry policy, aggregate outcomes |
| `transport_parity.py` | Declared vs observed transport audit (tokens, json lock, truncation field) |
| `score_law.py` | Provider-neutral pass / decisive_failure / scale normalization |
| `gate_closure_reconcile.py` | Reconcile algorithm + receipt schema |
| `panel_types.py` | `PanelJudgeOutcome`, `TransportReceipt`, `ReconciliationReceipt` |
| `panel_registry.py` | Register adapters by provider_key (generic dict, no app imports) |

---

## Execution Order

| Wave | Focus | Est. Tokens |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **W0** | ADR, boundary receipt, Author-Gate, protocol spec | ~40K |
| **W1** | Core harness + unit tests (fake adapters) | ~120K |
| **W2** | `apps_rg` adapter migration + parity proof | ~100K |
| **W3** | CI governance, deprecate ad-hoc audits, docs | ~50K |

**Dependency:** `exec-summary-x1d-transport-parity-d8f2a1` W1–W2 should complete (or be explicitly merged into W2 here) before `apps_rg` deletes hand-rolled `_call_*` orchestration.

## Out Of Scope

- Rewriting Exit-eval L3 judges to use panel harness (separate track)
- Replacing `JudgeJuryRunner` candidate-selection semantics
- `agentic_core` owning apps_rg rubric text or X2 validator implementations
- Mandatory second-app (`apps_lic`) adoption in initial release
- Weakening X2 gates or judge thresholds to force panel PASS
- Live API proof as sole DoD for W1 (unit tests + fake adapters only)

## Gap Register

**GAP-1: Dual judge stacks during migration**
- `LLMJudgeGateway` (profile-based) vs `JudgePanelRunner` (contract-based) coexist until unified profile refs land.
- Mitigation: document when to use each; W3 docs only, no forced merge.

**GAP-2: apps_rg transport parity plan overlap**
- Risk of implementing same fix twice (apps-only vs core).
- Mitigation: W0.2 sequencing — apps plan remediates; core plan extracts harness.

**GAP-3: Author-Gate receipt** — **RESOLVED**
- `author_gate_receipt_ref`: `artifacts/governance/migration_receipts/20260524_core_judge_panel_harness.json`

---

## Definition of Done

DoD-1: Core panel package exists with frozen public API and unit tests
- Evidence: `pytest tests/unit/agentic_core/runtime/judges/panel/ -q` → 0 failed
- Status: DONE

DoD-2: Core smoke import (executable surface)
- Evidence: `python -c "from agentic_core.runtime.judges.panel import JudgePanelRunner, CanonicalJudgeContract"` exits 0
- Status: DONE

DoD-3: apps_rg `run_llm_judges` delegates to core panel with three adapters registered
- Evidence: `pytest tests/unit/apps_rg/test_x1d_judge_transport_parity.py -q` → 0 failed (after transport-parity prerequisites)
- Status: DONE

DoD-4: Boundary migration receipt + Author-Gate on disk
- Evidence: `artifacts/governance/migration_receipts/*_core_judge_panel*.json` exists; plan frontmatter `author_gate_receipt_ref` set
- Status: DONE

DoD-5: CI governance green for core addition
- Evidence: `python ops_scripts/ci/check_judge_panel_harness_boundary.py` → PASS (GOV-JPH in run_contract_gates)
- Status: DONE
