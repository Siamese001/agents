# Fort Knox + runtime signoff — dual-track governance (keep / clarify / wire)

One-sentence summary: **Keep Fort Knox as tamper-evident certification (notary) for RTC-REQ status; make runtime proof an explicit, cheap, documented second track** so agents and humans never confuse “bundle green” with “seam ran.”

> **plan_id discipline**: filename stem `fortknox-runtime-dual-track-b7c4e2` matches `plan_id` and Notion `Slug`. Wave markers: `plan=fortknox-runtime-dual-track-b7c4e2`.

## Context (SCQA)

- **Situation** — Fort Knox (compiler + verifier + atomic assertions + mutation rejection + canary) passes in CI; separate work produced **runtime evidence manifests** (e.g. pytest + junit + logs under `docs/reports/runtime_cert/`).
- **Complication** — Fort Knox was introduced partly to compensate for IDE/runtime proof weakness; **passing Fort Knox did not imply runtime correctness**, causing perceived low ROI and scope confusion.
- **Question** — How do we **preserve the integrity value** of Fort Knox while **making runtime signoff explicit, discoverable, and low ceremony**?
- **Answer** — **Dual-track discipline**: (1) *Certification track* = Fort Knox unchanged in role; (2) *Runtime track* = contract tests + command logs + optional small JSON manifests; **documentation + CI clarity + assertion hygiene** in waves below.

## Out Of Scope

- Replacing Fort Knox with in-toto **implementation** in this plan (documentation of path only).
- Rewriting all RTC-REQ rows or re-baselining the entire assertion ledger in one wave.
- Notion schema changes beyond standard Plans row for this plan.

---

## Wave 0 — Narrative SSOT (Fort Knox vs runtime)

WAVE_ID: W0
WAVE_STATUS: TODO
WAVE_COMPLETE: NO
AUTHORIZATION_STATUS: NOT_REQUIRED
CHECKPOINT: A

**Phases**:
- **W0.1** — Author `ADR-NNN-fortknox-runtime-dual-track.md` (or equivalent): definitions, anti-patterns (“Fort Knox proves runtime”), diagram optional | ~1.2k | PHASE_STATUS: TODO
- **W0.2** — `AGENTS.md` short subsection + `fortknox-evidence` SKILL “When not to invoke” / pointer to runtime template | ~1.3k | PHASE_STATUS: TODO

**Acceptance**:
- One canonical doc is citeable in reviews.
- Fort Knox skill opens with **two-sentence role boundary** + link.

## Wave 1 — CI posture (truth table)

WAVE_ID: W1
WAVE_STATUS: TODO
WAVE_COMPLETE: NO
AUTHORIZATION_STATUS: NOT_REQUIRED
CHECKPOINT: B

**Phases**:
- **W1.1** — Inventory each `check_fortknox_*` + where invoked; capture exit semantics (fail-closed vs advisory) | ~1.5k | PHASE_STATUS: TODO

- No accidental “everything advisory” without explicit decision recorded.

---

## Wave 2 — Assertion ledger hygiene

WAVE_ID: W2
WAVE_STATUS: TODO
WAVE_COMPLETE: NO
AUTHORIZATION_STATUS: NOT_REQUIRED
CHECKPOINT: B

- **W2.2** — **New assertion checklist**: when to add RTC-REQ row; requirement for paired runtime or static proof path | ~2k | PHASE_STATUS: TODO

**Acceptance**:
- Checklist merged; audit artifact path recorded in plan completion note.

---

## Wave 3 — Runtime evidence template

WAVE_ID: W3
WAVE_STATUS: TODO
WAVE_COMPLETE: NO
AUTHORIZATION_STATUS: NOT_REQUIRED

**Phases**:
- **W3.1** — Template: directory layout, `runtime_signoff_manifest.json` optional schema, pytest+junit+log triad | ~1.5k | PHASE_STATUS: TODO

WAVE_STATUS: TODO
WAVE_COMPLETE: NO
AUTHORIZATION_STATUS: NOT_REQUIRED
CHECKPOINT: C

**Phases**:
- **W4.1** — Document retirement triggers: what would allow shrinking Fort Knox (e.g. in-toto replaces compiler) per existing constitutional note | ~2k | PHASE_STATUS: TODO

**Acceptance**:
- Appendix or ADR section linked from W0 ADR.

---

## Gap Register

| ID | Gap | Wave |
|----|-----|------|
| G1 | Contributors confuse Fort Knox PASS with runtime PASS | W0, W3 |
| G2 | Unclear which Fort Knox gates are strict on main | W1 |
| G3 | Assertion ledger grows faster than signal | W2 |
| G4 | No single “runtime signoff pack” template | W3 |
| G5 | No documented off-ramp when industry attestation matures | W4 |

---

## Definition of Done

| DoD ID | Criterion | Verification |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| DoD-1 | Canonical **dual-track** narrative exists (ADR or equivalent) and is linked from AGENTS and Fort Knox skill | Link check + PR review |
| DoD-2 | **CI truth table** committed: every `check_fortknox_*` + invocation + strict/advisory | Doc path listed in completion note |
| DoD-3 | **Assertion contribution checklist** merged (new rows require paired proof class) | File path in repo |
| DoD-4 | **Runtime evidence template** published and one example referenced | Template path + example path |
| DoD-5 | **Smoke:** `python -m pytest tests/_apps_contract/test_apps_rg_app_payload_consumption.py::test_full_dispatch_succeeds_with_ag2_wiring --override-ini="addopts=" -q` exits **0** (token runtime seam alive after doc-only waves) | Command + exit code in wave note |
| DoD-6 | **Notion** Plans row exists with `Exists On Disk=true`, path `.cursor/plans/fortknox-runtime-dual-track-b7c4e2.md`, Status progressed honestly | Notion page id in completion note |

### Verification vs deferral

| Item | Verify now | Defer |
|------|------------|-------|
| Fort Knox compiler / verifier code changes | No — not required for this plan | Any compiler schema change → separate platform plan |
| in-toto / Sigstore rollout | No | Until ADR-091 execution plan exists |
| Migrating all historical plans to runtime template | No | Incremental per plan |

---

## Risks / Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Over-long ADR nobody reads | One page max; deep detail in SKILL |
| Tightening CI causes churn | W1.2 is explicit decision + env flag |
| Assertion audit becomes blame game | W2.1 is factual inventory + criteria, not retroactive mass delete |
