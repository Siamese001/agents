# L2 + apps_rg rationalization (12 waves)

Rationalize agentic_core L2 validators/executors/healers and apps_rg section runtime: inventory SSOT, model env boundaries, same-authority healing, quarantine non-product paths, gated archive. **Evidence reports:** `docs/reports/agent_inventory/`.

> **plan_id:** `l2-rationalization-waves-c8e4f1` → markers use `plan=l2-rationalization-waves-c8e4f1`

## Context (SCQA)

- **Situation** — Early-learning L2.2/L2.3/L2.4 components, shared spine model envs, and apps_rg section runtime coexist; inventory and ownership docs exist under `docs/reports/agent_inventory/`.
- **Complication** — Label drift (L2.x vs E2/E3/E4), model env bleed risk, stub signal-quality paths, and non-product smoke/demo entries can be mistaken for live proof.
- **Question** — How do we safely rationalize L2 spine vs apps_rg product paths without breaking canonical section generation or Exit/UWG boundaries?
- **Answer** — Twelve bounded waves: document ownership (W0–W1), guard env boundaries (W2–W4), enforce healing and boundaries (W5–W10), gated archive only after fan-in zero (W11).

## Out Of Scope

- Live full `python -m apps_rg` proof runs (unless explicitly scoped per wave)
- Weakening X2/X3 gates or judge rubrics
- Deletion or deprecation markers before W11 gates
- Generic agentic_core feature work unrelated to rationalization

---

## Wave 0 — Inventory SSOT

WAVE_ID: W0
WAVE_STATUS: DONE
WAVE_COMPLETE: YES
AUTHORIZATION_STATUS: NOT_REQUIRED

**Acceptance:** Assessment JSON + compileall 0. See [l2_rationalization_repo_assessment.json](../docs/reports/agent_inventory/l2_rationalization_repo_assessment.json).

---

## Wave 2 — Generation model env guards

WAVE_ID: W2
WAVE_STATUS: TODO

## Waves 4–11 (summary)

Detail in [l2_rationalization_full_wave_plan.md](../docs/reports/agent_inventory/l2_rationalization_full_wave_plan.md).

| Wave | One-line objective |
|------|-------------------|
| W4 | Signal-quality SSOT wire or quarantine apps_shared stubs |
| W5 | Same-authority healing negative tests |
| W6 | Retire `agentic_core/L2_execution/apps_rg_l2_binding.py` |
| W7 | proof_eligible manifest; quarantine dry_run/Rg*/stub |
| W8 | Single SSOT runner per section lane |

| W10 | Exit/UWG/L4/L6 no-bypass contract tests |
| W11 | Archive only after fan-in zero + 30d quarantine |

## Gap Register

**GAP-1: validation_orchestrator vs l2_phase_pipeline E2**
- Duplicate validation surfaces — defer to W9 NEEDS_DECISION

**GAP-2: apps_shared signal stubs**
- subatomic_hop_util / engine_type_types — defer to W4 Author-Gate

**GAP-3: legacy_full_resume rollback**
- Keep vs sunset — NEEDS_DECISION before W7 manifest

- Status: TODO

DoD-4: Same-authority healing runtime-proven
- Evidence: W5 negative tests + OTel spans

## ADG_GRAPH_LAYER_EVIDENCE

Rationalization scope is driven by latest `artifacts/adg/adg_indexed_*.sqlite` graph-layer primitives (constitutional §22):

| Primitive | Use in this plan |
|-----------|------------------|
| `mv_hotspot_centrality` | Rank L2/L5 fan-in hotspots (W0 inventory, W11 gate) |
| `mv_blast_radius` | Blast-radius for validator/executor moves |
| `mv_chokepoints` | Identify orchestration chokepoints before archive |
| `flows_to` / `reads_from` / `writes_to` | Execution vs read vs durable-write surfaces |
| `v_p0_high_fanin` | P0 seam selection for spine rationalization |

Evidence reports under `docs/reports/agent_inventory/` were produced with ADG MCP (`adg_edge_fanin`, `adg_nodes_by_file`) — not grep-for-deps.

## ADG_HOTSPOT_REPORT

| Rank | Symbol / path | Archetype | ADG Surface | Notes |
|------|---------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | `agentic_core/L2_execution/reasoning/execution_gateway.py` | ORCHESTRATOR | Execution Surface | Primary L2 dispatch hub |
| 2 | `agentic_core/L2_execution/reasoning/validation_orchestrator.py` | ORCHESTRATOR | Execution Surface | W11 fan-in gate |
| 3 | `agentic_core/L5_safety/config/structure_blueprint/ssot.py` | CENTRAL_DEPENDENCY | State Surface | Parent plan cross-ref; ratchet tracked separately |
| 4 | `apps_rg/runtime/section_runtime/*` | STATE_NODE | Write Surface | Product path — apps-owned, not core leakage |
