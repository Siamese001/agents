# Phase 1 SSOT Compliance Implementation Plan

This plan addresses critical SSOT compliance violations through a carefully phased approach that minimizes risk by processing files in small, manageable batches with comprehensive validation at each step.

## Wave Structure

| Waves | Metric | Scope | Checkpoint | Tokens |
|-------|--------|-------|------------|---------|
| Wave 1 | Analysis & Discovery | Review current state | A | 25,000 🟢 |
| Wave 2 | Implementation | Core changes | B | 50,000 🟢 |
| Wave 3 | Testing & Validation | Verify changes | C | 30,000 🟢 |
| Wave 4 | Documentation & Cleanup | Finalize | D | 15,000 🟢 |

**Total: 120,000 tokens across 4 waves, all GREEN**

## Overview

Phase 1 focuses on the highest-priority violations: VALIDATOR (335 files), CONFIG naming (128 files), and SCRIPT file remediation (498 files). The implementation is divided into 10 sub-phases to ensure safe execution with rollback capabilities.

## Sub-Phases

### Sub-Phase 0.1: Preparation and Safety Net (Day 0)
- Create full repository backup using git tag
- Implement dry-run validation script that simulates all changes
- Set up automated compliance verification
- Create rollback procedures for each sub-phase
- Establish success criteria and validation checkpoints

### Sub-Phase 0.2: VALIDATOR - Low-Risk Pilot (Day 1)
- Target: 10-20 validator files in non-critical paths
- Focus: Files with minimal dependencies
- Action: Rename to `_validator.py` suffix
- Validation: Run test suite, verify imports
- Rollback trigger: Any test failure

### Sub-Phase 0.3: VALIDATOR - Core Safety Validators (Day 2)
- Target: `agentic_core/L5_safety/validators/` directory
- Priority: Critical safety components
- Action: Rename to `_validator.py` suffix
- Special handling: Update FileClassificationAgent references
- Validation: Full integration tests

### Sub-Phase 0.4: VALIDATOR - Domain Validators (Day 3)
- Target: Validators in domain directories
- Action: Rename to `_validator.py` suffix
- Validation: Domain-specific tests
- Risk mitigation: Process one domain at a time

### Sub-Phase 0.5: CONFIG - Core Configuration Files (Day 4)
- Target: `agentic_core/config/` directory
- Action: Rename to `_config.py` suffix
- Special handling: Preserve import statements
- Validation: Configuration loading tests

### Sub-Phase 0.6: CONFIG - Layer Configuration Files (Day 5)
- Target: Config files in L0-L6 layers
- Action: Rename to `_config.py` suffix
- Validation: Layer-specific functionality tests
- Risk mitigation: Process per layer

### Sub-Phase 0.7: SCRIPT - ops_scripts/ Verification (Day 6)
- Action: Verify all ops_scripts/ files follow snake_case
- Target: Any outliers (if found)
- Validation: Script execution tests
- Note: Expected to find no violations

### Sub-Phase 0.8: SCRIPT - Root-Level Critical Scripts (Day 7)
- Target: 20-30 high-impact root-level scripts
- Action: Rename to snake_case and move to ops_scripts/
- Priority: Scripts used in CI/CD or core operations
- Validation: Pipeline tests, script execution

### Sub-Phase 0.9: SCRIPT - Root-Level Batch Processing (Day 8-9)
- Target: Remaining root-level scripts in batches of 50
- Action: Rename to snake_case and move to ops_scripts/
- Validation: Incremental batch testing
- Error handling: Isolate batch failures

### Sub-Phase 0.10: SCRIPT - Final Validation (Day 10)
- Action: Complete compliance audit
- Validation: Full test suite, integration tests
- Documentation: Update all references
- Performance verification: No regressions

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Batch Processing
- Process files in small batches (10-50 per batch)
- Validate each batch before proceeding
- Isolate failures to specific batches

### Dependency Tracking
- Map all file dependencies before starting
- Update imports systematically
- Verify no broken references

### Automated Validation
- Pre-commit hooks for compliance checking
- Automated test execution after each batch
- Continuous compliance monitoring

### Rollback Procedures
- Git-based rollback for each sub-phase
- Automated script to revert changes
- Point-in-time recovery options

## Success Criteria

### Functional Criteria
- 100% of tests pass after each sub-phase
- No broken imports or references
- All scripts execute successfully

### Compliance Criteria
- 0 VALIDATOR naming violations
- 0 CONFIG naming violations
- 0 SCRIPT naming violations at root
- 100% compliance with SSOT hierarchy

### Performance Criteria
- No performance regressions
- All CI/CD pipelines pass
- System functionality preserved

## Tools and Scripts

### Validation Scripts
- `validate_ssot_compliance.py` - Full compliance check
- `batch_validator.py` - Per-batch validation
- `import_checker.py` - Verify no broken imports

### Automation Scripts
- `rename_validator.py` - Safe validator renaming
- `rename_config.py` - Safe config renaming
- `move_script.py` - Safe script relocation

### Monitoring Tools
- Compliance dashboard
- Real-time violation tracking
- Automated reporting

## Timeline

- **Total Duration**: 
- **Daily Validation**: End-of-day compliance check
- **Milestone Reviews**: After each sub-phase
- **Final Audit**: Day 10 comprehensive review

## Dependencies

- Must have full repository backup
- Test suite must be stable and passing
- CI/CD pipeline access for validation
- Stakeholder approval for each sub-phase

## Rules

1. Follow all constitutional rules and guidelines
2. Maintain compliance with established standards
3. Document all changes and decisions
4. Validate all implementations before completion
