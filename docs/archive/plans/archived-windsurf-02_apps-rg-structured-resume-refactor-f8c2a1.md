## Portfolio Consolidation Notes
This plan has been merged into the master consolidation with conflict resolution:
- Phase 0: Runtime path inventory (W0A)
- Phase 10: Structured resume schema + PA tiering + Exit G21/G22
- Phase 11: C0 fact_vectors integration with structured resume
- Phase 12: Canonical L6 handoff (NOT repair of l6_shadow_learning.py)

**CRITICAL**: W10 L6 Shadow Learning Repair is superseded by Master Phase 2 (delete/quarantine L6) and Phase 12 (canonical handoff verification). Do not implement W10 as originally written.

**Resume Shipping Critical Path:**
- W1-W6 are promoted into the Resume Shipping Critical Path (Master Plan S0-S6).
- W9 judges remain inventory only and are not required before first resume sending.
- W10 remains superseded and must not repair `l6_shadow_learning.py`.

# Refactor apps_rg to Structured Resume with Tiered Customization

Refactor the apps_rg resume generation pipeline to use a structured source resume JSON with separated narrative/bullets and implement tiered customization strategies per role section. Patch existing runtime paths to correctly display U0→L2 live pipeline vs L6 shadow/future-run boundaries.

## Context (SCQA)

- **Situation** — Current apps_rg has multiple overlapping runtime paths (runtime/bindings, runtime/section_*, integrations/hops, engines/judges) with unclear ACTIVE vs LEGACY vs QUARANTINED status. The `pa_binding.py` exists but needs role-aware tiering. The `runtime_executive_summary.py` incorrectly implies L6 and Cache are part of live pipeline.

- **Complication** — Heavy customization roles (Unify, IBM) need bullet rewriting with JD alignment, but existing code has quarantined judges and multiple abandoned paths. Need to inventory existing surface before creating new frameworks. Core boundary must be strictly enforced: no agentic_core modifications, no G01-G29 renames, no canonical schema changes.

- **Design Decisions from 2026-05-13 Session** —
  1. **Narrative copied verbatim** — No LLM customization; U0 supplies briefing, JD, base resume
  2. **Bullets tiered by role** — Unify (current): Top 3 heavy rewrite, 4-5 moderate, 6 light. IBM: Top 2 moderate, 3-5 light. InsurTech/EY: Light reframe. Early career: Preserve verbatim.
  3. **Provider-neutral prompts** — XML-style sections, no Claude-specific wording, Qwen vLLM compatible
  4. **Anti-invention guardrails** — NO new metrics/clients/tools/domains/scope/titles/impacts without source support. INSUFFICIENT_SOURCE_SUPPORT emitted when evidence inadequate.
  5. **Exact source-span extraction** — Verbatim citation required before rewrite, JSON output with source_span, jd_alignment, rewritten_bullet, blocked_items, status
  6. **Hard core boundary** — apps_rg may consume agentic_core contracts but NEVER modify core, G01-G29, or canonical X1/X2/X3 schemas
  7. **L6 is shadow-only** — Never part of live generation pipeline; only future-run learning

- **Question** — How do we consolidate the existing fragmented apps_rg runtime surface, patch the active paths to enforce core boundaries, and implement tiered customization without creating parallel frameworks?

- **Answer** — Inventory and classify all existing paths (W0A), patch the single active dispatch→bindings→runtime path (W2/W4), inventory existing judge surface before any new creation (W9). W10 is superseded: do not repair apps_rg/runtime/l6_shadow_learning.py. Structured resume scope may only verify canonical Exit -> RuntimeExhaustBundle handoff through the master plan.

## Wave Overview

**Waves**: 11 total (W0A, W1–W8, W9, W10) including W6.0
**Total Estimate**: ~7,800 tokens
**Current**: W2
**Last Completed**: W1
**Initial Classification Hypothesis, to be verified by W0A**:

| Path | Classification | Rationale | Binding Evidence Required |
|------|---------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| `apps_rg/runtime/bindings/*.py` | **ACTIVE** | U0→L1→L0→C0→PA→L2→Exit spine per plan d4e8a1 | Import graph proves dispatch uses these |
| `apps_rg/runtime/dispatch/apps_rg_dispatch.py` | **ACTIVE** | Entry point for `python -m apps_rg` | Import graph + dry-run test |
| `apps_rg/runtime/section_*.py` | **LEGACY** | Per-section pipeline was aspirational; section logic moves to PA | Import graph confirms no active imports |
| `apps_rg/integrations/hops/*.py` | **QUARANTINED** | AG-RGGOV-8 runtime authority | Import graph proves no active imports |
| `apps_rg/engines/judges/*.py` | **QUARANTINED** | `executive_positioning_judge.py` has QUARANTINE notice | Import graph proves no active imports |
| `apps_rg/integrations/gates/online_judges.py` | **QUARANTINED** | RuntimeError on import | Import graph proves no active imports |
| `apps_rg/reasoning/` | **OUT_OF_SCOPE** | Unfunded complexity; no active reasoning loop | Mark archived |
| `apps_rg/tools/` | **ACTIVE** | Utility tools (word_count, context_format) used by bindings | Import graph proves bindings use these |
| `apps_rg/_quarantine/` | **QUARANTINED** | `compiler.py`, `HardenedanthropicexecutorStrategy.py`, `ResumeAssemblyAgent.py` | Already isolated |

**Acceptance**:
- **Import graph generated** via `tools/analysis/import_graph_builder.py` or static analysis
- Classification is **evidence-based**, not aspirational — every ACTIVE classification must have import proof
- **Mismatch blocks W0A completion**: If import graph shows active imports from QUARANTINED paths, W0A fails
- CI gate `check_apps_rg_runtime_path_inventory.py` verifies:
  - No imports from quarantined paths in active code
  - Exactly one active path: `apps_rg_dispatch.py` → `bindings/` → spine
  - Deprecation warnings on LEGACY paths (section_*.py)
- Tests prove: `python -m apps_rg --help` imports only from `bindings/`, `dispatch/`, `tools/`

## Consolidated Section Processing Design

| Section | Pipeline | Narrative | Bullets | Count | Treatment Tier | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------|-------|----------------|-----------|
| **Headline** | U0→L1→L0→C0→PA→L2→Exit | Single X\|Y\|Z line | N/A | 1 line | **Heavy** | High JD visibility, keyword optimization critical |
| **Executive Summary** | U0→L1→L0→C0→PA→L2→Exit | 5-sentence paragraph | N/A | 5 sentences | **Heavy** | Flagship positioning, every sentence needs metric/scope/technical term |
| **Unify** | U0→L1→L0→C0→PA→L2→Exit | 1 intro sentence (verbatim) | 6 bullets | 6 | **Top 3: Heavy, 4-5: Moderate, 6: Light** | Current role, highest investment |
| **IBM** | U0→L1→L0→C0→PA→L2→Exit | 1 intro sentence (verbatim) | 5 bullets | 5 | **Top 2: Moderate, 3-5: Light** | Supporting relevance |
| **InsurTech** | U0→L1→L0→C0→PA→L2→Exit | 1 intro sentence (verbatim) | 3 bullets | 3 | **Moderate** | Background context |
| **EY** | U0→L1→L0→C0→PA→L2→Exit | 1 intro sentence (verbatim) | 3 bullets | 3 | **Light** | Older experience |
| **Early Career** | U0→L1→L0→C0→PA→L2→Exit | 1 intro sentence (verbatim) | 1 bullet | 1 | **Preserve Verbatim** | Historical record |
| **Competencies** | U0→L1→L0→C0→PA→L2→Exit | N/A | 12 entries | 12 | **Moderate** | JD-ranked, 2-4 word noun phrases |
| **Education** | **Verbatim Copy** | Exact from source | N/A | All | **None** | No LLM generation |
| **Certifications** | **Verbatim Copy** | Exact from source | N/A | All | **None** | No LLM generation |

### Treatment Tier Definitions (Role-Aware)

| Role | Bullets | Tier Assignment |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Unify** | 6 | 1-3: Heavy, 4-5: Moderate, 6: Light |
| **IBM** | 5 | 1-2: Moderate, 3-5: Light |
| **InsurTech** | 3 | All: Moderate |
| **EY** | 3 | All: Light |
| **Early Career** | 1 | Verbatim (no LLM) |

**Key Principle**: Narratives (intro sentences) are **copied verbatim** from structured source. Only achievement bullets go through agentic spine with tiered treatment.

## Allowed Change Surface

**Explicitly Allowed to Change** (app-specific paths only):

| Path | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| `apps_rg/runtime/bindings/*` | U0→L1→L0→C0→PA→L2→Exit spine bindings |
| `apps_rg/runtime/runtime_executive_summary.py` | W4 bug patch for correct display |
| `apps_rg/runtime/l6_shadow_learning.py` | SUPERSEDED / REFERENCE ONLY — do not repair. Duplicate app-local L6 runtime must be deleted or quarantined unless live caller proof exists. Structured resume scope may only verify canonical Exit -> RuntimeExhaustBundle handoff through Master Phase 12. |
| `apps_rg/runtime/schemas/*` | App-specific schemas (SectionArtifact, etc.) |
| `apps_rg/config/domain_contract/*` | App profiles, rubrics, thresholds |
| `tests/_apps_contract/test_apps_rg_*.py` | App-specific test coverage |
| `ops_scripts/ci/check_apps_rg_*.py` | CI gates for apps_rg |
| `ops_scripts/ci/check_agentic_core_leakage.py` | W5 core boundary enforcement |
| `ops_scripts/ci/check_major_checkpoint_core_boundary.py` | W5 checkpoint validator |
| `artifacts/apps_rg/**/*` | App-specific build artifacts |

**Explicitly Forbidden to Change**:

| Path | Rationale | Violation Action |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| `agentic_core/**/*` | Core must remain app-agnostic | CI gate BLOCKS, checkpoint fails |
| Canonical G01-G29 gate definitions | Governance stability | CI gate BLOCKS, checkpoint fails |
| Canonical X1/X2/X3 schemas | Exit eval stability | CI gate BLOCKS, checkpoint fails |
| `.windsurf/rules/*` | Global governance rules | Exception: rule update plans only |
| Global plan templates (`execution-plan-template.md`) | Cross-plan consistency | Exception: template update plans only |

## Wave 0A — Active Runtime Path Inventory

**Phases**:
- **W0A.1** — Inventory all runtime/bindings, runtime/section_*, integrations/hops, integrations/gates, engines/judges, reasoning/, tools/, _quarantine/
- **W0A.2** — Create CI gate to enforce classification; block new files in quarantined paths

**Acceptance**:
- Classification table in plan (ACTIVE/LEGACY/QUARANTINED/OUT_OF_SCOPE)
- Exactly one active generation path: `apps_rg_dispatch.py` → `bindings/` → spine
- CI gate passes: no imports from quarantined paths in active code
- Tests prove: `python -m apps_rg --help` imports only from `bindings/` and `dispatch/`
- Deprecation warnings on LEGACY paths (section_*.py)

---

## Wave 1 — Structured JSON Schema + Exit Binding Ingestion ✅ COMPLETED

**Critical Reframe**: Standardize resume input to structured JSON with normalized identifiers and clear separation of narrative vs bullets.

**Status**: COMPLETED — 89 tests passing (48 schema + 19 exit binding + 22 normalized IDs)

**Phases**:
- **W1.1** ✅ — Define Structured Resume Schema with normalized IDs (`source_resume_v2_structured.json`)
- **W1.2** ✅ — Update Exit Binding to produce structured format from DOCX (`produce_structured_resume_from_docx()`) |

**Schema Requirements** (`source_resume_v2_structured.json`):

```python
StructuredResumeV2:
  schema_version: "2.0.0"           # Explicit version
  resume_id: str                    # Unique resume identifier
  
  sections: List[Section]
  
Section:
  # Normalized identifiers
  section_id: str                    # "headline", "executive_summary", "unify", "ibm", "insurtech", "ey", "early_career", "competencies", "education", "certifications"
  company_id: Optional[str]         # Normalized: "unify_consulting", "ibm", "ernst_young", etc.
  
  # Content classification
  content_kind: str                  # "narrative_only", "bullets_only", "narrative_and_bullets", "verbatim_copy"
  
  # Processing policy
  rewrite_policy: str                # "heavy", "moderate", "light", "verbatim"
  judge_policy: str                  # "p0_full_panel", "p1_full_panel", "p2_deterministic_only", "none"
  
  # Content
  narrative: Optional[str]           # Intro sentences (verbatim for experience sections)
  bullets: List[str]                # Achievement bullets (tiered treatment)
  verbatim_fields: Optional[Dict]   # Exact copy fields for education/certifications
  
  # Provenance
  source_location: str              # JSON path in original DOCX
  extraction_confidence: float       # 0.0-1.0
```

**Normalized ID Conventions**:

| Field | Format | Examples |
|-------|--------|----------|
| `section_id` | lowercase_snake | `"headline"`, `"executive_summary"`, `"unify"`, `"ibm"`, `"insurtech"`, `"ey"`, `"early_career"`, `"competencies"`, `"education"`, `"certifications"` |
| `company_id` | lowercase_snake | `"unify_consulting"`, `"ibm"`, `"ernst_young"`, etc. |
| `content_kind` | snake_case | `"narrative_and_bullets"`, `"bullets_only"`, `"verbatim_copy"` |
| `rewrite_policy` | lowercase | `"heavy"`, `"moderate"`, `"light"`, `"verbatim"` |
| `judge_policy` | pN_descriptor | `"p0_full_panel"`, `"p2_deterministic_only"`, `"none"` |

**Acceptance**:
- `source_resume_v2_structured.json` validates against schema with `schema_version: "2.0.0"`
- Exit binding produces structured format from DOCX with all normalized IDs
- All required fields present: `section_id`, `company_id`, `content_kind`, `rewrite_policy`, `judge_policy`
- Verbatim fields (header, education, certifications) extracted exactly with `content_kind: "verbatim_copy"`
- Tests: `test_source_resume_schema_v2.py`, `test_exit_binding_structured_output.py`

---

## Wave 2 — PA Binding Tiered Prompt Patching

**Critical Reframe**: This is NOT creating a new PA layer. It patches `apps_rg/runtime/bindings/pa_binding.py` to add role-aware tiering.

**Phases**:
- **W2.1** — Add role detection from `experience[].company` → tier assignment
- **W2.2** — Polish provider-neutral XML structure, anti-invention rules

**Acceptance**:
- `pa_binding.py` detects: Unify→heavy/moderate/light, IBM→moderate/light, InsurTech/EY→light, Early Career→verbatim
- System preamble uses provider-neutral wording (no Claude references)
- Bullet rewrite prompt includes tiered treatment instructions
- Anti-invention rules embedded: NO new metrics/clients/tools/domains without source support
- Tests: `test_pa_binding_role_tiering.py` verifies correct tier per role

---

## Wave 4 — Runtime Executive Summary Bug Patch

**Critical Reframe**: This is NOT a new feature. It patches bugs in `runtime_executive_summary.py` to correctly display the live pipeline vs shadow boundaries.

**Required Display Corrections**:

```
LIVE GENERATION PIPELINE (U0 → L2):
  U0 Validate ──► L1 Plan ──► L0 Route ──► C0 Retrieve ──► PA Compose ──► L2 Execute ──► Exit Finalize
  
POST-RUNTIME (NO PRODUCTION IMPACT):
  RuntimeExhaustBundle emitted: YES/NO
  L6 Shadow Handoff emitted: YES/NO
  G29 Learning Firewall: PASS/WARN/FAIL
  
WRITE-BACK STATUS (REQUIRES UWG RECEIPTS):
  inert_writeback_candidates: <count>
  uwg_committed_writes: <count> (only with ExitReceipt)
  
NO LIVE CACHE WRITES WITHOUT UWG
NO L6 IN LIVE PIPELINE
NO AUTONOMOUS LEARNING MUTATION
```

**Removed Claims**:
- ~~"L6 part of live pipeline"~~ → L6 is shadow-only, future-run
- ~~"Cache writes durable"~~ → Only with UWG receipts
- ~~"Semantic cache immediate"~~ → inert_writeback_candidates until UWG

**Acceptance**:
- `runtime_executive_summary.py` displays corrected ASCII table
- Tests verify no L6 in live path claims
- Tests verify "inert" prefix on writeback candidates without receipts

---

## Wave 5 — Core Boundary Enforcement + Checkpoint CI

**Hard Constraints**:
- apps_rg may consume existing `agentic_core` contracts
- apps_rg may NOT modify `agentic_core/**`
- apps_rg may NOT rename or redefine G01-G29
- apps_rg may NOT modify canonical X1/X2/X3 schemas
- Violations fail CI immediately

**Phases**:
- **W5.1** — CI gate `check_agentic_core_leakage.py` + `check_major_checkpoint_core_boundary.py`
- **W5.2** — Tests verify no apps_rg literals added to core files

**CI Scripts Created**:

| Script | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `check_agentic_core_leakage.py` | `ops_scripts/ci/` | Detect apps_* literals, imports, conditionals in agentic_core |
| `check_major_checkpoint_core_boundary.py` | `ops_scripts/ci/` | Run at every major checkpoint (pre/post wave, pre-commit, pre-merge) |

**Checkpoint Schedule**:

| Checkpoint | When | Action |
|------------|------|--------|
| `pre-wave` | Before W1, W2, W3... | Verify core clean, no staged core changes with leakage |
| `post-wave` | After each wave complete | Verify no leakage introduced during wave execution |
| `pre-commit` | Before every `git commit` | Block commit if core leakage detected in staging |
| `pre-merge` | Before merge to main | Comprehensive scan + uncommitted core change check |
| `post-core-edit` | After any agentic_core edit | Immediate verification, alert on leakage |

**Acceptance**:
- CI gate fails if `git diff agentic_core/` non-empty (with fail-closed)
- CI gate fails if `grep -r "apps_rg" agentic_core/` finds new literals
- CI gate fails if G01-G29 definitions changed
- CI gate fails if X1/X2/X3 canonical schemas modified
- Checkpoint log at `artifacts/ci/checkpoint_core_boundary_log.jsonl` tracks every run
- All waves must pass `post-wave` checkpoint before marking complete

---

## Wave 6.0 — Canonical Exit Harness Wiring

**Critical Prerequisite**: G21/G22 evidence is useless if Exit never consumes it through the canonical path. Ensure apps_rg Exit uses the canonical Exit flow BEFORE adding richer G21/G22/X1D evidence.

**Required Runtime Path**:

```
apps_rg sealed output
  -> SealedWorkflowPackage or canonical terminal package
  -> ExitReviewPacket
  -> X1CheckoutResult
  -> X2AggregationResult
  -> GateMeshResult
  -> ExitDispositionReceipt
  -> RuntimeExhaustBundle
```

**Scope**:
- `apps_rg/runtime/bindings/exit_binding.py`
- `apps_rg/exit/apps_rg_exit_evidence_builder.py`
- `apps_rg/config/domain_contract/exit_profile.resume_generation.v1.json`
- `tests/_apps_contract/test_apps_rg_exit_integration.py`

**Hard Constraints**:
- Do not modify `agentic_core`
- Do not modify canonical X1/X2/X3 schemas
- Do not redefine G01-G29
- Do not let apps_rg emit final X3 directly if canonical ExitDispositionReceipt is required
- Do not let local stub gates replace GateMeshResult
- **UNKNOWN is never PASS**

**Acceptance**:
- apps_rg constructs/normalizes the terminal output into the expected Exit input shape
- ExitReviewPacket is created for apps_rg runs
- X1CheckoutResult is produced or populated with explicit UNKNOWN/NOT_APPLICABLE reasons

## Wave 6 — Exit Gate Payload Extensions (G21/G22)

**Critical Gap Closure**: G21 (Schema/Completeness) and G22 (Quality/Safety) currently DORMANT or PARTIAL. **apps_rg emits app-owned evidence payloads** for existing canonical G21/G22 — NO canonical gate modifications.

**Core Principle**: Canonical G21/G22 gates remain unchanged. apps_rg produces **app-specific evidence receipts** that the generic Exit evaluation consumes alongside canonical signals.

**Phases**:
- **W6.1** — AppsRgSectionValidationReceipt: Per-section schema validation (headline XYZ, bullet counts, structure)
- **W6.2** — AppsRgMetricPreservationEnvelope: Metric extraction from source vs generated, preservation proof
- **W6.3** — AppsRgVerbatimIntegrityReceipt: Hash-based proof for education, certifications, early career

**New Evidence Types** (app-owned, not canonical):

```python
AppsRgSectionValidationReceipt:
  receipt_id: str                    # Unique receipt identifier
  run_id: str                        # Parent run
  section_id: str                    # "headline", "executive_summary", "unify", etc.
  g21_schema_check: G21CheckResult   # Headline XYZ format, bullet count, structure
  g22_quality_check: G22CheckResult  # Metric presence, anti-invention flags
  timestamp: datetime
  evidence_digest: str               # Hash of validation inputs

AppsRgHeadlineValidationReceipt:
  receipt_id: str
  headline_text: str
  xyz_format_valid: bool             # X|Y|Z structure
  xyz_parsed: {x: str, y: str, z: str}
  jd_keyword_density: float          # Keywords from JD present
  seniority_signal_detected: bool    # SVP/C-suite language

AppsRgMetricPreservationEnvelope:
  envelope_id: str
  section_id: str
  source_metrics: List[Metric]        # Extracted from source resume
  generated_metrics: List[Metric]   # Extracted from generated output
  preservation_ratio: float         # % of source metrics preserved
  invented_metrics: List[Metric]     # Any metrics not in source (BLOCKED)
  blocked_inventions: List[str]      # Attempted inventions caught by anti-invention

AppsRgVerbatimIntegrityReceipt:
  receipt_id: str
  section_id: str                    # "education", "certifications", "early_career"
  source_hash: str                    # SHA256 of source content
  generated_hash: str                 # SHA256 of generated content
  hash_match: bool                   # Must be True for verbatim sections
  verbatim_preservation_verdict: "PASS" | "FAIL" | "NOT_APPLICABLE"

AppsRgClaimSupportMap:
  map_id: str
  section_id: str
  claims: List[Claim]                 # Claims made in generated output
  claim_support_status: Dict[str, "SUPPORTED" | "INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE" | "BLOCKED"]
  source_spans: Dict[str, List[str]]  # Verbatim source supporting each claim
```

**Acceptance**:
- G21 gates ACTIVE via apps-owned receipts: Headline parses as X|Y|Z, 12 competency bullets present, all P0 sections have content
- G22 gates ACTIVE via apps-owned receipts: Metrics preserved from source, early career copied verbatim (hash match)
- **NO canonical G21/G22 changes**: All evidence is app-specific, consumed by generic Exit eval
- Exit gate emits enriched payload with per-section gate results
- Tests: `test_apps_rg_section_validation_receipt.py`, `test_apps_rg_metric_preservation.py`, `test_apps_rg_verbatim_integrity.py`
- Checkpoint: `post-wave W6` proves no modifications to `agentic_core/**/g21_*.py` or `**/g22_*.py`

---

## Wave 7 — C0 Evidence Trust & Retrieval Safety

**Critical Gap Closure**: G08 (Evidence Trust) and G13 (Retrieval Safety) currently UNFUNDED. **C0 remains evidence-only** — NO answer generation, NO prompt assembly, NO direct L4 writes.

**Core Principle**: C0 supplies evidence to PA/L2. C0 does not generate answers, compile prompts, or write to L4. Apps-specific evidence tracing captures provenance.

**Phases**:
- **W7.1** — AppsRgEvidenceTraceMap: Per-section evidence provenance with full traceability
- **W7.2** — Retrieved Content Trust: Injection risk detection, source span verification, blocked claims tracking

**New Evidence Type** (app-owned trace map):

```python
AppsRgEvidenceTraceMap:
  map_id: str
  run_id: str
  request_id: str
  section_id: str                    # Section this evidence supports
  
  # Provenance hashes
  source_resume_hash: str           # Hash of full source resume
  jd_hash: str                      # Hash of job description
  briefing_hash: str                # Hash of research briefing
  
  # Retrieval trace
  retrieval_query_hash: str         # Hash of query sent to retriever
  retrieved_chunk_refs: List[str]   # References to retrieved chunks
  retrieved_chunk_hashes: List[str] # Verification hashes
  
  # Source-to-claim mapping
  source_span_refs: List[SourceSpan] # Exact source spans available
  claim_refs: List[ClaimRef]        # Claims that will be made
  blocked_claims: List[BlockedClaim] # Claims blocked due to insufficient evidence
  
  # Status
  support_status: "SUFFICIENT" | "PARTIAL" | "INSUFFICIENT"
  injection_risk_score: float       # 0.0-1.0, threshold at 0.15
  content_safety_verdict: "PASS" | "REVIEW" | "BLOCK"
  
  # Contract reference
  final_evidence_contract_ref: str   # Reference to C0 FinalEvidenceContract

SourceSpan:
  span_id: str
  source_location: str               # JSON path in source resume
  verbatim_text: str                # Exact text
  hash: str                         # Verification hash

ClaimRef:
  claim_id: str
  claim_text: str                   # The claim to be made
  supporting_span_ids: List[str]     # SourceSpan IDs that support this
  support_status: "VERIFIED" | "UNVERIFIED" | "BLOCKED"

BlockedClaim:
  claim_text: str                   # Claim that was blocked
  reason: "NO_SOURCE_SUPPORT" | "CONTRADICTS_SOURCE" | "INJECTION_RISK" | "SAFETY"
  required_source_type: str          # What evidence would be needed
```

**Acceptance**:
- C0 retrieves only evidence relevant to section being generated (per-section scoping)
- **NO C0 answer generation**: C0 supplies evidence, PA/L2 generate answers
- **NO C0 prompt assembly**: PA composes prompts
- **NO C0 direct L4 writes**: All writes via Exit/X3 or inert until UWG
- Retrieved content hash-verified against source (retrieved_chunk_hashes)
- No evidence cross-contamination between sections (per-section trace maps)
- Injection risk score computed per evidence item (threshold 0.15)
- Blocked claims tracked with reasons (NO_SOURCE_SUPPORT, CONTRADICTS_SOURCE, etc.)
- Tests: `test_apps_rg_evidence_trace_map.py`, `test_c0_no_answer_generation.py`, `test_c0_no_direct_l4_write.py`
- Checkpoint: `post-wave W7` proves no C0 code changes that add answer generation or L4 write paths

## Wave 8 — Identity, Budget, L6 Firewall + Inert Writeback

**Phases**:
- **W8.1** — Identity & Isolation: U0 caller binding, session isolation
- **W8.2** — Budget & L6 Firewall: Token/cost caps, L6 learning-only mode enforcement
- **W8.3** — Inert Writeback Candidate Envelope: Distinguish candidates from committed writes

**New Evidence Type** (W8.3 — inert writeback envelope):

```python
AppsRgInertWritebackCandidate:
  candidate_id: str
  run_id: str
  section_id: str
  
  # Content
  proposed_content: str             # Content that could be written back
  content_hash: str                 # Verification hash
  
  # Admission requirements
  requires_x3c: bool = True         # Requires X3C exit certification
  requires_uwg_admission: bool = True  # Requires UWG approval
  
  # Status (initially inert)
  durable_commit_occurred: bool = False  # FALSE until UWG admits
  inert_until_uwg: bool = True      # TRUE until admitted
  
  # Timeline
  created_at: datetime
  x3c_certification_ref: Optional[str]  # Populated after X3C
  uwg_admission_ref: Optional[str]    # Populated after UWG approval
  committed_at: Optional[datetime]    # Populated after durable commit

RuntimeExhaustBundle (extended):
  # ... existing fields ...
  inert_writeback_candidates: List[AppsRgInertWritebackCandidate]
  uwg_committed_writes: List[AppsRgInertWritebackCandidate]  # Subset with durable_commit_occurred=True
```

**Runtime Summary Display** (must distinguish):

```
POST-RUNTIME STATUS:
  X3C Certification: PASS/WARN/FAIL
  
WRITE-BACK STATUS:
  inert_writeback_candidates: <count> (requires X3C + UWG)
  uwg_committed_writes: <count> (durable commits with receipts)
  
L6 SHADOW (FUTURE-RUN ONLY):
  L6 Shadow Handoff: YES/NO
  G29 Learning Firewall: PASS/WARN/FAIL
  inert_proposals: <count> (gauntlet→UWG→L4 path only)
```

**Acceptance**:
- U0 validates caller identity, binds to session
- Budget caps enforced (token limit, cost limit)
- L6 operates in learning-only mode (no production impact)
- G29 firewall receipt required for any L6 output activation
- **W8.3**: Runtime summary distinguishes `inert_writeback_candidates` from `uwg_committed_writes`
- **W8.3**: `durable_commit_occurred=False` for all candidates until UWG receipt present
- Tests: `test_apps_rg_inert_writeback_candidate.py`, `test_runtime_summary_inert_vs_committed.py`

---

## Wave 9 — Judge Surface Consolidation (Inventory First)

**Critical Reframe**: Do NOT create new judge framework until existing surface is inventoried.

**Existing Files to Inventory**:

| File | Status | Content | Decision |
|------|--------|---------|----------|
| `engines/judges/executive_positioning_judge.py` | QUARANTINED | RuntimeError on import | Keep quarantined; reference for prompts only |
| `engines/judges/__init__.py` | QUARANTINED | Empty | Keep quarantined |
| `config/domain_contract/judge_profile.resume_generation.v1.json` | ACTIVE | Dimension definitions, thresholds | **WRAP** — Use as config source for X1D |
| `config/domain_contract/judge_prompts.yaml` | ACTIVE | LLM-as-judge prompts | **WRAP** — Use as prompt templates for X1D |
| `config/domain_contract/grader_roster.yaml` | ACTIVE | Grader references | **WRAP** — Use as roster spec for X1D |
| `integrations/gates/online_judges.py` | QUARANTINED | RuntimeError on import | Keep quarantined; do not use |
| `integrations/hops/*` | QUARANTINED | Runtime authority | Keep quarantined; no judge calls from here |

**Judge Role Boundary** (strict enforcement):

```
JUDGE PRODUCES X1D EVIDENCE ONLY

Judges MAY:
  ✓ Produce X1D evidence packets (JudgeResult, scores, rationale)
  ✓ Emit quality assessments with confidence scores
  ✓ Flag insufficient evidence or blocked claims
  ✓ Recommend retry or HITL (advisory only)

Judges MAY NOT:
  ✗ Emit GateVerdict (PASS/FAIL/BLOCK) — X3 owns this
  ✗ Emit X3 disposition — Exit/X3 owns final say
  ✗ Trigger retry or regeneration — L3/L4 orchestration owns this
  ✗ Mutate current-run state — shadow-only
  ✗ Write directly to L4 — must route through gauntlet/UWG
  ✗ Autonomously PASS P0 sections when uncalibrated — advisory only

Copy-verbatim sections (education, certifications, early career):
  → Use deterministic checks only (hash compare, schema validation)
  → NO subjective LLM judges
  → Judges produce no evidence for these sections

Calibration requirements:
  UNCALIBRATED judges → advisory_only=True, no autonomous PASS
  CALIBRATED judges (Spearman ≥ 0.80) → may contribute to PASS with deterministic checks
```

**Inventory Decision Matrix**:

| Option | Action | When |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Migrate** | Move working code to new location | If existing code is sound but misplaced |
| **Wrap** | Adapter layer around existing config | If existing config is valid but needs runtime |
| **Replace** | New implementation | If existing code is fundamentally broken |

**Phases**:
- **W9.1** — Complete inventory of all judge-related files with classification + Judge Role Boundary documentation
- **W9.2** — Decision: Migrate/Wrap/Replace per file; do not create parallel framework

**Acceptance**:
- Inventory table complete with all 7+ files classified
- **Judge Role Boundary** documented and enforced: Judges produce X1D evidence only, no GateVerdict, no X3, no retry, no L4 write, no autonomous PASS when uncalibrated
- Decision recorded for each: Migrate/Wrap/Replace
- No new `apps_rg/runtime/judges/` created until inventory complete
- If "Wrap" chosen: Adapter uses existing config files as SSOT
- If "Replace" chosen: Explicit rationale why existing config cannot be used
- Tests: `test_judge_produces_x1d_only.py`, `test_judge_no_gate_verdict.py`, `test_uncalibrated_advisory_only.py`, `test_copy_verbatim_no_judges.py`

---

## Wave 10 — SUPERSEDED / REFERENCE ONLY: Canonical L6 Handoff Verification Only

**SUPERSEDED ORIGINAL INTENT — DO NOT IMPLEMENT**

The original W10 intent was to repair `apps_rg/runtime/l6_shadow_learning.py` by extending duplicate local classes such as RuntimeExhaustBundle, SectionCompletedEvalRecord, AggregateCompletedEvalRecord, and ProposalPacket.

**Resolution:**
- Do not repair `apps_rg/runtime/l6_shadow_learning.py`.
- Do not extend duplicate app-local RuntimeExhaustBundle or ProposalPacket classes.
- Do not create or preserve an app-local L6 runtime engine.
- Delete or quarantine the duplicate app-local L6 runtime unless live caller proof exists.
- Structured resume may only verify canonical Exit -> RuntimeExhaustBundle handoff.
- G29 and promotion proof fields remain owned by the separate Core G29 plan.

**Reference-only historical requirements, superseded:**
- RuntimeExhaustBundle ref completion
- SectionCompletedEvalRecord enrichment
- AggregateCompletedEvalRecord enrichment
- ProposalPacket promotion path fields
- l6_shadow_learning.py acceptance tests

**Active acceptance for structured resume scope:**
- No change to `apps_rg/runtime/l6_shadow_learning.py`.
- No active W10 implementation task remains in this plan.
- Any canonical L6 handoff verification is owned by Master Phase 12.
- Any G29/promotion proof work is owned by `core-l6-g29-promotion-proof-hardening-d9e3b2.md`.

---

## Core Boundary Contract

```
APPS_RG BOUNDARY — NON-NEGOTIABLE

apps_rg MAY:
  ✓ Import and use agentic_core contracts (ValidatedRequest, L1PlanContract, etc.)
  ✓ Implement app-specific logic in apps_rg/** only
  ✓ Consume canonical G01-G29 gates via Exit binding
  ✓ Produce X1D evidence for X2 aggregation → X3 disposition
  ✓ Shadow learning in L6 (strictly future-run)

apps_rg MAY NOT:
  ✗ Modify any file in agentic_core/**
  ✗ Rename or redefine G01-G29
  ✗ Modify canonical X1/X2/X3 schemas
  ✗ Import from quarantined paths (integrations/hops, engines/judges)
  ✗ Emit autonomous PASS from uncalibrated judges
  ✗ Run subjective judges for copy-verbatim sections
  ✗ Claim L6 in live pipeline
  ✗ Claim durable writes without UWG receipts

VIOLATION = CI FAIL (run_contract_gates.py)
```

## ADG_GRAPH_LAYER_EVIDENCE

> RETROACTIVE_EVIDENCE_PATCH — added 2026-05-14 per GAP-C7 remediation batch 2.

- **MV**: `mv_hotspot_centrality` — `apps_rg/runtime/executive_summary.py` identified as ORCHESTRATOR; all resume-path exit verdicts flow through this node
- **MV**: `mv_dependency_cone_risk` — `apps_rg/runtime/bindings/exit_binding.py` at L3/Exit carries ×1.75 layer multiplier; cone risk elevated due to Security + Execution surface intersection
- **MV**: `mv_graph_reverse_dependency_hotspots` — `apps_rg/prompt_assembly/compiler.py` is a reverse-dependency hotspot; W2 PA patching and W8 inert writeback changes both fan into this node
- **Semantic edge**: `apps_rg/__main__.py` →`flows_to`→ `apps_rg.runtime.executive_summary` (dispatch chain); `executive_summary` →`writes_to`→ `ExitResult` (inert writeback path W8)
- **Surface references**: Execution Surface (runtime dispatch, judge evaluation), State Surface (inert writeback types, L6 handoff), Prompt Surface (PA compiler, 8-slot model)
