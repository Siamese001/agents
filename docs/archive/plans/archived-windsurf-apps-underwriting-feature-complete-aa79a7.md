# Plan — `apps_underwriting_ai` Feature-Complete Domain Logic

**Slug:** `apps-underwriting-feature-complete-aa79a7`
**Created:** 2026-05-02
**Tier:** T3 (cross-module, multi-file, regulated-domain surface)
**Driver:** DEFERRED_SCOPE row from `apps-completeness-remediation-907fac` (completed 2026-05-02)
**Status:** Completed (2026-05-02)
**Predecessors:**
- `.windsurf/plans/apps-completeness-remediation-907fac.md` (Completed 2026-05-02 — built canonical skeleton)
- `.windsurf/plans/apps-completeness-followups-287d2a.md` (Completed 2026-05-02 — docs + contract tests)
- `.windsurf/plans/apps-underwriting-ai-activation-e8a3c5.md` (concurrent, in motion — already landed `DeterministicRiskScorer` + LLM rationale enrichment)

## Goal

Close the remaining skeleton-to-functional gap in `apps_underwriting_ai`. Explicitly stays on the skeleton-to-functional side of the SME cliff — **real actuarial/regulatory domain logic remains deferred** and requires jurisdiction-specific review (see `SVP_ENGINEERING_REVIEW.md` §"Skeleton Boundary" and `engines/risk_scorer.py` module docstring).

This plan completes the **structural and surface parity** with `apps_rfp` (the canonical sibling) after the activation effort lands. It does NOT promote the package to regulator-grade underwriting.

## Scope Boundary (IMPORTANT)

**IN scope:**
- `parsers/` package — minimal document parsers (PDF text extraction, structured-JSON ingestion, CSV)
- `validators/` package — minimal compliance gates (required-field presence, risk-score ceiling/floor invariants, rubric-coverage gates)
- `services/` package — rubric-wiring service, LLM judge telemetry service, pre-migration audit tooling service
- `tools/` package — CLI utilities matching apps_rfp shape (`run_underwriting.py`, `audit_spine_manifest.py`)
- Rubric wiring — cleanly connect `policy/rubrics/judge_underwriting_decision.yaml` to assembler telemetry
- Contract tests for the new surfaces (parsers, validators, services)

**OUT of scope (deferred):**
- Actuarial model replacing `DeterministicRiskScorer` — requires jurisdictional SME
- Bias / fairness audit — requires external party
- Regulatory review (FCA / OCC / FINRA / FDIC / SEC / CFPB jurisdictions)
- Real OCR of PDF evidence — requires OCR provider + prompt-injection defense
- Production LLM routing — current Qwen-first cascade is demonstration-grade only

## Files In Scope (NEW)

### Wave 1 — Parsers
- `apps_underwriting_ai/parsers/__init__.py` (expand from ~200b stub to full package)
- `apps_underwriting_ai/parsers/document_parser.py` (NEW — base class)
- `apps_underwriting_ai/parsers/json_document_parser.py` (NEW — structured JSON ingress)
- `apps_underwriting_ai/parsers/csv_document_parser.py` (NEW — CSV evidence tables)
- `apps_underwriting_ai/parsers/pdf_text_parser.py` (NEW — text-only PDF extraction via `pypdf`)

### Wave 2 — Validators

### Wave 3 — Services
- `apps_underwriting_ai/services/__init__.py` (NEW package)
- `apps_underwriting_ai/services/rubric_wiring_service.py` (NEW — loads `policy/rubrics/judge_underwriting_decision.yaml` into assembler)
- `apps_underwriting_ai/services/llm_judge_telemetry_service.py` (NEW — emits judge-result events to ObservabilityAdapter)
- `apps_underwriting_ai/services/pre_migration_audit_service.py` (NEW — scans the package for durable-write leakage, consumed by spine_manifest)

### Wave 4 — Tools
- `apps_underwriting_ai/tools/__init__.py` (NEW package)
- `apps_underwriting_ai/tools/run_underwriting.py` (NEW — CLI mirror of apps_rfp)
- `apps_underwriting_ai/tools/audit_spine_manifest.py` (NEW — validates `spine_manifest.yaml` claims against source)

### Wave 5 — Rubric wiring
- `apps_underwriting_ai/engines/decision_packet_assembler.py` (EDIT — wire `RubricWiringService` into rationale enrichment flow)
- `apps_underwriting_ai/integrations/observability_adapter.py` (EDIT — new `emit_judge_result` method)

### Wave 6 — Tests

## Gap Register

- `parsers/` package is declared in `TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` §5 as a skeleton seam but currently an empty namespace package (~200b `__init__.py`).
- `validators/` same situation — declared, declared, empty.
- `services/` package not yet created; `apps_rfp` has a `services/` pattern apps_underwriting_ai should mirror.
- `tools/` package not yet created; `apps_rfp` has `tools/` pattern.
- `policy/rubrics/judge_underwriting_decision.yaml` exists (from activation effort) but is not yet wired into runtime code — it's documentation-only until rubric wiring service lands.
- Test parity gap: 61 contract tests exist (from `287d2a`) but no coverage for parsers/validators/services/tools/CLI.

## DEFERRED_SCOPE (post-this-plan)

DEFERRED_SCOPE: title=`apps_underwriting_ai regulator-grade actuarial model` reason=`replacing DeterministicRiskScorer with jurisdictional actuarial model requires SME engagement, bias audit, and regulatory review; plan aa79a7 deliberately stays on skeleton-to-functional side` plan=`TBD` predecessor=`apps-underwriting-feature-complete-aa79a7`

DEFERRED_SCOPE: title=`apps_underwriting_ai real OCR evidence ingestion` reason=`PDF text parser (W1 P1.4) handles text-only PDFs; image-PDF OCR requires OCR provider integration + prompt-injection defense; separate security-reviewed scope` plan=`TBD` predecessor=`apps-underwriting-feature-complete-aa79a7`

## ADG_HOTSPOT_REPORT

Skipped: this is a **structural-completeness / skeleton-graduation** plan, not a hotspot-driven refactor. Targets are determined by apps_rfp parity-gap enumeration. Per `.windsurf/rules/adg-graph-layer-enforcement.md`, hotspot ordering is required for **anti-pattern burndown / refactoring** plans; this is neither.

## ADG_GRAPH_LAYER_EVIDENCE

When executed, this plan should verify:
- **`mv_task_contract_gaps`** for `apps_underwriting_ai` — reduces as parsers/validators/services land with real contract edges
- **`mv_trace_replay_eval_gaps`** — reduces as LLM judge telemetry service lands
- **`mv_prompt_assembly_wiring_gaps`** — reduces as rubric wiring service lands (connects YAML → runtime code)
- **`mv_runtime_spine_gaps`** — `audit_spine_manifest.py` (P4.2) validates the spine_manifest claims programmatically
- Semantic edges: `reads_from` (rubric YAML), `resolves_callsite` (rubric dispatch into assembler), `controls_flow` (validator composition)
- `v_p1_*` / `v_p2_*` views: apps_underwriting_ai rows should decrease as stubs become real

## Verification Strategy (when executed)

- **W1 done** = `pytest apps_underwriting_ai/tests/test_parsers.py -v` passes; ≥12 tests
- **W2 done** = `pytest apps_underwriting_ai/tests/test_validators.py -v` passes; ≥15 tests
- **W3 done** = `pytest apps_underwriting_ai/tests/test_services.py -v` passes; ≥10 tests
- **W4 done** = `pytest apps_underwriting_ai/tests/test_tools.py -v` passes; ≥6 tests; `python -m apps_underwriting_ai.tools.run_underwriting --help` works
- **W5 done** = Assembler emits `judge_result` event when rubric wiring enabled; existing 10-test contract suite still passes
- **W6 done** = Total `pytest apps_underwriting_ai/tests/` ≥104 tests, all pass
- **Plan done** = `python -m apps_underwriting_ai --demo` still emits valid DecisionPacket end-to-end AND rubric coverage is non-zero AND pre-migration audit passes

## Coordination With Activation Plan

Plan `apps-underwriting-ai-activation-e8a3c5` is in motion concurrently. Coordination points:
- This plan's P5.1 (rubric wiring into assembler) touches the same file as the activation plan's LLM enrichment — **sequence AFTER activation plan completes** to avoid merge conflict
- Do not modify `engines/risk_scorer.py` — owned by activation plan
- Do not modify `engines/decision_packet_assembler.py` imports — owned by activation plan; only add new method calls, do not rearrange
- Pre-execution: verify activation plan status is `Completed` before starting W5
