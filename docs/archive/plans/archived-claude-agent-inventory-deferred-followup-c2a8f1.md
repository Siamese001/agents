# Agent Inventory — Deferred Follow-Up

Execute deferred work from [agent-inventory-spine-taxonomy-b4e9f2](agent-inventory-spine-taxonomy-b4e9f2.md) (W0–W3 **Completed** 2026-05-25). Parent delivered ADR-088, four-axis taxonomy, CI A1/A2, RootCustoms archive, and W3 live spine proof with **0** artifact-proven `*Agent` invocations. This plan owns **integrated product proof**, optional HOW class-identity (product-gated), and physical misplacement burndown.

> **plan_id discipline:** `plan=agent-inventory-deferred-followup-c2a8f1`

## Context (SCQA)

- **Situation** — Parent closed with function-based spine canon, 197 taxonomy entries, `ARTIFACT_PROVEN=0` for `agentic_core` agents, misplacement ledger documented.
- **Complication** — W3 live runner exercised production path but L2 modular R4 failed lane prerequisites; full `python -m apps_rg` green proof and physical moves remain open; Decision 1 (class on HOW) explicitly deferred.
- **Question** — How do we complete product proof and layout cleanup without conflating taxonomy with spine invocation?
- **Answer** — **Register-first (W0)**, then integrated live proof (W1), product-gated ADR for class identity (W2), Author-Gate physical moves (W3), shim removal (W4).

## Status tables

### Wave progress

| Wave | Focus | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| W0 | Deferred register + plan linkage | Not Started |
| W1 | Integrated R4 live product proof (apps_rg) | Not Started |
| W2 | Decision 1 — class identity ADR (approve or permanent defer) | Not Started |
| W3 | Physical misplacement moves (Author-Gate per class) | Not Started |
| W4 | RootCustoms thin shim removal after burndown | Not Started |

### Deferred scope map

| ID | Title | Wave |
|----|-------|------|
| DS-1 | Full green `python -m apps_rg` integrated proof | W1 |
| DS-2 | Optional HOW `invoked_class` (product approval) | W2 |
| DS-3 | Misplacement ledger physical moves | W3 |
| DS-4 | RootCustoms shim delete | W4 |
| DS-5 | A2 maintenance — no `ARTIFACT_PROVEN` without proof | All waves |

---

## Out of scope

- Reopening parent W0–W3 taxonomy axis schema (frozen unless ADR).
- Bulk `NOT_AGENT` on L5/healing inventory rows.
- Using mock `_spine_proof_run/` to flip `product_spine_invocation_status`.
- Deleting L6 snapshot harness shim as misplacement cleanup.

## Wave summary

| Wave | Phase IDs | Focus | Est. tokens | Success criteria |
|------|-----------|-------|-------------|------------------|
| W0 | W0.1 | Publish/link deferred register | ~2k | Register on disk; parent Notion Completed |
| W1 | W1.1 | `PYTEST_APPS_RG_INTEGRATED_LIVE=1` or canonical CLI green | ~60k | Product proof receipt; still 0 `*Agent` unless DS-2 approved |
| W2 | W2.1 | ADR draft: class identity on HOW | ~8k | ACCEPTED ADR or explicit REJECTED + permanent defer marker |
| W3 | W3.1–W3.4 | One Author-Gate move per misplacement row | ~20k | ADG fan-in proof per move |
| W4 | W4.1 | Remove RootCustomsAgent.py shim | ~4k | Zero importers; tests green |

## Definition of done

DoD-1: Deferred register published and linked from parent closeout  
DoD-2: W1 integrated live proof receipt (PASS or honest BLOCKED with provider/lane evidence)  
DoD-3: W2 Decision 1 resolved in writing (ADR or defer permanent)  
DoD-4: W3 moves executed or each row has DEFERRED_SCOPE + P-Band  
DoD-5: `ARTIFACT_PROVEN` count unchanged unless DS-2 approved and proof artifacts exist
