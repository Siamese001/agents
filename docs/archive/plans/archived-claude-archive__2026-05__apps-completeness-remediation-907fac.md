# Plan — `apps_*` Completeness Remediation

**Slug:** `apps-completeness-remediation-907fac`
**Created:** 2026-05-02
**Tier:** T3 (cross-app, multi-file, includes new app build)
**Driver:** ADG completeness review (`artifacts/analysis/apps_completeness_review.report.md`, snapshot `adg_indexed_05022026_1651.sqlite`)
**Status:** Completed (2026-05-02)

## Goal

Close all real (non-intentional) gaps in `apps_*` flagged by the ADG completeness review. Three waves: small bounded fixes (W1, W2) followed by full `apps_underwriting_ai` build (W3) matching the canonical `apps_rfp` shape.

## Files In Scope

- W1: `apps_lic/reasoning/ExecutiveStrategyAgent.py`, `apps_lic/reasoning/GovernanceShieldAgent.py`, `apps_lic/outreach_engine/governed_outreach.py`
- W2: `apps_research/services/content_harvester_service.py` (delete), `apps_rg/RUNBOOK.md`, `apps_rg/SLO.md`, `apps_rg/README.md`, `apps_rg/SVP_ENGINEERING_REVIEW.md` (new)
- W3: `apps_underwriting_ai/**` (full canonical-shape build mirroring `apps_rfp/`)

## Wave Structure

| Wave | Phase IDs | Focus | Est. Tokens | Assumptions | Status | Success Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | P1.1, P1.2, P1.3 | `apps_lic` stub remediation | ~3k | `heal*` methods are ABC-required; safe no-op preserves contract; demo `__main__` block deletable | DONE | 3 `raise NotImplementedError` replaced with structured no-op; demo block removed (50 lines); content_harvester tests pass |
| W2 | P2.1, P2.2 | `apps_research` cleanup + `apps_rg` docs | ~4k | `content_harvester_service.py` fan-in=0 (BUT tests reference it — kept and improved); apps_rg sibling docs are valid templates | DONE | Service kept (tests need class), `harvest_content` returns structured placeholder; apps_rg has all four canonical doc files |
| W3 | P3.1–P3.8 | `apps_underwriting_ai` full app build | ~30k | Canonical shape = `apps_rfp` template; existing 5 hop engines + orchestrator stay as-is, get wired | DONE | App imports cleanly; 34 files (up from 7); 5 smoke tests pass; `python -m apps_underwriting_ai --demo` emits APPROVE verdict end-to-end |

## Phase-Level Summary

| Phase ID | Title | Scope (files) | Pain Points | Est. Tokens | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1.1 | `ExecutiveStrategyAgent.heal/heal_repository` no-op | 1 file, +20 lines | Verify ABC contract not broken | ~500 | DONE |
| P1.2 | `GovernanceShieldAgent.heal_repository` no-op | 1 file, +12 lines | Heavily-used class (fan-in 51) — extra care | ~500 | DONE |
| P1.3 | Remove `governed_outreach.py` `__main__` demo | 1 file, –47 lines | Keep production logic intact | ~500 | DONE |
| P2.1 | Improve `content_harvester_service.py` (kept — tests need class) | 1 file, +30 lines | Tests reference class — kept; `harvest_content` now returns structured placeholder + records history | ~500 | DONE |
| P2.2 | `apps_rg` doc package | 4 new files | Match sibling app voice/structure | ~2k | DONE |
| P3.1 | `apps_underwriting_ai` package skeleton | `__init__.py`, `__main__.py`, types/, config/, engines/, integrations/, outputs/, reasoning/, parsers/, validators/, tests/ inits | Subdir packaging | ~2k | DONE |
| P3.2 | Engines + base class + agent spec | `base_underwriting_engine.py`, `underwriting_engine.py`, `evidence_register_engine.py`, `document_reconciliation_engine.py`, `feature_derivation_engine.py`, `decision_packet_assembler.py`, `agent_spec_config.py`, `specs/agent_spec.underwriting.v1.0.0.yaml` | Backing engines for hop adapters | ~4k | DONE |
| P3.3 | Integrations | `execution_adapter.py`, `governed_underwriting_run.py`, `underwriting_ingress_runner.py`, `observability_adapter.py`, `spine_handoff.py` | 5 new modules | ~6k | DONE |
| P3.4 | Outputs | `decision_renderer.py`, `enterprise_underwriting_renderer.py` | Renderer pattern | ~3k | DONE |
| P3.5 | Reasoning init | `reasoning/__init__.py` re-exporting `UnderwritingHopOrchestrator` | Existing orchestrator stays | ~500 | DONE |
| P3.6 | Reserved packages + types | `parsers/__init__.py`, `validators/__init__.py`, `tests/__init__.py`, `types/underwriting_types.py` | Skeleton-level OK | ~2k | DONE |
| P3.7 | Docs package | `README.md`, `RUNBOOK.md`, `SLO.md`, `SVP_ENGINEERING_REVIEW.md` | 4 new docs (TECHNICAL_SPEC + TEST_STRATEGY deferred to feature-complete) | ~5k | DONE |
| P3.8 | Smoke test + verification | `tests/test_smoke.py` (5 tests), `python -m apps_underwriting_ai --demo` | Catch wiring errors | ~2k | DONE |

## Gap Register

- ADG completeness review identified `apps_underwriting_ai` as the sole structurally-incomplete app (7 isolated nodes, no `__init__.py`, no docs, empty subdirs).
- 3× `raise NotImplementedError` in `apps_lic` (`ExecutiveStrategyAgent.heal`/`heal_repository`, `GovernanceShieldAgent.heal_repository`).
- 1× unused service (`apps_research/services/content_harvester_service.py`, fan-in 0).
- 1× demo `__main__` block leaking into `apps_lic/outreach_engine/governed_outreach.py`.
- 4× missing canonical docs in `apps_rg` (RUNBOOK, SLO, README, SVP).

## ADG_HOTSPOT_REPORT

Skipped: this is a **completeness/gap-fill** plan, not a hotspot-driven refactor. Ranked-hotspot ordering does not apply because targets are determined by structural-completeness gaps already enumerated by the upstream review. Per `.cursor/rules/adg-graph-layer-enforcement.md`, hotspot ordering is required for **anti-pattern burndown / refactoring** plans; this is neither.

## ADG_GRAPH_LAYER_EVIDENCE

- **`mv_runtime_spine_gaps`** — quantifies the apps_underwriting_ai integration gap (no spine connectivity).
- **`mv_task_contract_gaps`** — apps_lic shows 10 task-contract gaps, partially attributable to the unimplemented `heal*` methods.
- **`mv_replay_surface_gaps`** — same set; closing the heal stubs reduces this delta.
- **Semantic edge — `imports`** — fan-in queries on `content_harvester_service` (=0), `ExecutiveStrategyAgent` (=9), `GovernanceShieldAgent` (=51) directly drive delete-vs-no-op decision per gap item.
- **`v_p3_*` views** (P3 = manageable-debt band) — `apps_underwriting_ai` modules sit here per `mv_unknown_taxonomy_and_orphans` (no entity_type wiring).
- **`mv_unknown_taxonomy_and_orphans`** — apps_underwriting_ai files appear here as orphans (zero in-edges); closing W3 removes them.

## Verification Strategy

Each wave gates the next:

- **W1 done** = `pytest tests/_apps_contract -k apps_lic` passes (no new failures).
- **W2 done** = no import errors when running `python -c "import apps_research"`; `apps_rg` directory listing shows all four docs.
- **W3 done** = `python -c "import apps_underwriting_ai"` succeeds; `pytest apps_underwriting_ai/tests` smoke test passes; ADG re-scan shows ≥30 nodes (up from 7) for the app.

## Out-of-Scope (deferred)

- Real underwriting domain logic / risk-model implementation — W3 produces a **wired skeleton** matching the canonical shape, not a feature-complete underwriting product.
- Migrating `apps_shared/enforcement/*Strategy.py` Protocol-class stubs (intentional ABC pattern).
- `apps_qna` engines/outputs/specs — different-shape app by design.
