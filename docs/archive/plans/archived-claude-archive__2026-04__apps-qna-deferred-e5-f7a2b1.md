# apps_qna — E5 Deferred Scope

Deferred scope items from the completed `apps-qna-spine-deferred-e9c5b3` plan (D1–D4, 108 tests).
These items were explicitly deferred during implementation and require future work to move from
stub/heuristic/optional to production-grade implementations.

**Parent Plan**: `.windsurf/plans/apps-qna-spine-deferred-e9c5b3.md` (Completed)
**Created**: 2026-05-05

## Deferred Items

### E1: Real C0 Vector-Store Retrieval (~35K)

**E1.1: Replace stub fetcher in c0_adapter.py**
- Current: `_call_canonical_c0()` uses `_stub_fetch` returning an empty `CandidateEvidencePool`
  and `_stub_adjacency` returning `()`. No vector store is queried.
- File: `apps_qna/c0_adapter.py` lines 96–100
- Needed: Wire a real BGE-M3 / embedding-backed vector store for interview card retrieval.
  The `_stub_fetch` signature is `(plan, route) -> CandidateEvidencePool` — replace with a
  real fetcher calling `apps_qna/integrations/spine_adapter.py` or a dedicated retrieval store.
- Impact: Changes `evidence_sufficiency` from `template_only` → `grounded` for real slugs;
  unlocks real `FinalEvidenceContract.grounded=True` paths throughout the eval pipeline.
- Dependencies: A vector store populated with interview card embeddings (BGE-M3 via spine_adapter).

**E1.2: Populate interview card vector store**
- Current: No store exists; `spine_adapter.py` wraps BGE-M3 but has no indexed corpus.
- Needed: Index the canonical card corpus (22 cards × N interview archetypes) into a
  retrievable store (ChromaDB or equivalent) keyed by `interview_slug`.
- Impact: Prerequisite for E1.1.

### E2: Production LLM Judges (~40K)

**E2.1: context_recall_judge.py — replace heuristic with LLM call** ✅ DONE (2026-05-06)
- Dual-path: LLM preferred (via `provider_context.dispatch()`), heuristic fallback.
- Auto-builds `QnaProviderContext` from env when no context injected
  (`build_judge_provider_context_from_env()` — reads `JUDGE_PROVIDER`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `VLLM_MODEL_NAME`/`VLLM_BASE_URL`).
- Evidence tag: `context_recall::v2::llm_judge=<score>`.

**E2.2: context_precision_judge.py — replace heuristic with LLM call** ✅ DONE (2026-05-06)
- Same dual-path pattern as E2.1. Evidence tag: `context_precision::v2::llm_judge=<score>`.

**E2.3: answer_relevancy_judge.py — replace heuristic with LLM call** ✅ DONE (2026-05-06)
- Same env auto-build wired in; LLM path was already functional, now also activates
  without explicit injection. Evidence tag: `answer_relevancy::v2::llm_judge=<score>`.

**E2.4: Judge calibration against holdout corpus** ✅ DONE (two-tier calibration)
- Status: Two-tier Spearman-rank calibration implemented.
  **Tier 1 — Heuristic Sanity** (`apps_qna/holdout/rag_judge_holdout.yaml`, 120 examples):
    - context_recall: Spearman=1.0 ✅ | context_precision: Spearman=1.0 ✅ | answer_relevancy: Spearman=0.6526 ✅
    - Overall: 0.8596 ✅ (threshold ≥0.70)
    - Proves heuristic fallback stability — NOT semantic alignment.
  **Tier 2 — Human Semantic Alignment** (`apps_qna/holdout/rag_judge_holdout_semantic.yaml`, 90 examples):
    - context_recall: Spearman=1.0 → **promotion eligible** ✅
    - context_precision: Spearman=1.0 → **promotion eligible** ✅
    - answer_relevancy (heuristic): Spearman=0.4684 → **fallback-only** (expected, below 0.60)
    - answer_relevancy (LLM-backed): **Spearman=0.7931 (p<0.0001, n=30, 0 failures)** → **promotion eligible** ✅
      Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ via local vLLM. Dispatch: httpx → /v1/chat/completions.
  Test at `tests/_apps_contract/test_e2_llm_judge_calibration.py` (24 pass, 0 skip).
- Completed: LLM-backed answer_relevancy semantic calibration (2026-05-05).
  Dispatch refactored from LocalVLLMProvider (aiohttp/asyncio) to direct httpx sync calls
  to fix Windows ProactorEventLoop hang on repeated asyncio.run() calls.
- Remaining deferred: Human analyst calibration (real holdout labels from domain expert review).
- Impact: Enables automated quality regression detection in CI. answer_relevancy heuristic
  explicitly classified as fallback-only — not falsely promoted as semantically aligned.

### E3: Live Provider SDK Dispatch (~30K)

**E3.1: Wire QnaProviderContext to a real model call**
- Current: `apps_qna/integrations/provider_adapter.py` exposes `QnaProviderContext` with
  `model_id`, `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `has_model()` — but no actual model call is made.
  `build_provider_context()` acquires the canonical clock but has no dispatch path.
- Needed: Add `dispatch(prompt: str) -> str` to `QnaProviderContext` that calls the model
  identified by `model_id` via the canonical `agentic_core` provider SDK when `has_model()`
  is True. Must be fail-open — if model unavailable, return `""`.
- Impact: Enables the `R4_SINGLE_ACTION` live-interview route to make a real model call.

**E3.2: Wire PA adapter dispatch to provider**
- Current: `apps_qna/card_context/pa_adapter.py` runs PA.0–PA.7 pipeline checks but
  `dispatchable=True` does NOT trigger a model call — it just validates the context.
- Needed: When `dispatchable=True`, call `QnaProviderContext.dispatch()` with the
  assembled card context as the prompt. Return model output as `PAAdapterResult.model_output`.
- Impact: First real model-in-the-loop path for apps_qna.

### E4: Exit-Eval Hook Adoption + __main__.py Integration (~20K)

**E4.1: Wire maybe_invoke_exit_eval in __main__.py**
- Current: `apps_qna/config/cert_route_registry.yaml` has `invoke_exit_eval: true` but
  `apps_qna/__main__.py` does NOT call `maybe_invoke_exit_eval` from
  `apps_shared/cert/exit_eval_hook.py`. The flag is set but never checked at runtime.
  File: `apps_qna/__main__.py`
- Needed: Import and call `maybe_invoke_exit_eval(run_context, route_registry)` in the
  main run path, after the exit packet is emitted, to trigger the AppSpecificEvaluator.
- Pattern: `apps_rfp/__main__.py` already adopts this hook.
- Impact: Exit eval scores surface in `AppSpecificEvalResult`; enables HITL escalation.

**E4.2: emit_uwg_pack_record adoption in __main__.py**
- Current: `emit_uwg_pack_record()` from `apps_qna/exit_wiring.py` exists and is tested
  but is NOT called anywhere in the live run path — only reachable from tests.
- Needed: Call `emit_uwg_pack_record(manifest=..., exit_packet=..., enabled=cfg.uwg_enabled)`
  in `__main__.py` after the sealed manifest is built, gated by a config flag.
- Impact: Enables optional durable L4 state writes for interview packs.

### E5: SSOT Enforcement Gate + Config Drift CI (~15K)

**E5.1: Promote config_inventory scan to a CI gate**
- Current: `apps_qna/config/config_inventory.py` `scan_config_inventory()` runs as a
  library function with test coverage but is NOT wired into CI.
- Needed: Create `ops_scripts/ci/check_apps_qna_config_drift.py` that runs
  `scan_config_inventory()` and fails when `drift_violations` is non-empty or when
  any `policy_hash`-bearing config has a missing `version` or `status` field.
- Impact: Prevents silent policy_hash / version drift between domain_contract YAMLs.

**E5.2: Spine alignment gate**
- Current: `apps_qna/config/spine_alignment.py` `check_spine_alignment()` runs as a
  library function with test coverage but is NOT wired into CI.
- Needed: Add `check_spine_alignment()` call to the apps-spine-coverage CI scanner
  (`tools/analysis/apps_spine_coverage.py`) so unknown route types cause a gate failure.
- Impact: Prevents apps_qna from silently drifting to an unregistered route pattern.

**E5.3: Holdout partition lock after corpus freeze**
- Current: `EvalSetPolicy` (D3.2) assigns partitions deterministically by SHA-256 hash
  but the `salt` is mutable and not locked — changing it reassigns all slugs.
- Needed: Freeze the salt in `apps_qna/config/domain_contract/eval_rubrics.yaml` under
  a `holdout_salt` field and make `DEFAULT_EVAL_SET_POLICY` read it at import time.
  Add a CI check that alerts when `holdout_salt` changes (corpus-reassignment risk).
- Impact: Prevents accidental holdout contamination when the eval corpus grows.

## Implementation Notes

- **E1 prerequisite**: Vector store population (E1.2) must complete before E1.1.
- **E2 prerequisite**: Real model credentials / provider SDK in CI environment.
- **E3 prerequisite**: E2 judges must exist before provider dispatch adds value.
- **E4 can be done independently** — no dependency on E1/E2/E3.
- **E5 can be done independently** — purely CI/gate wiring.

Suggested sequencing: E4 → E5 → E1 → E2 → E3 (ascending cost/risk).
