# RCA: Wave 3 Clock Migration Gap (294 Remaining Sites)

**Incident ID**: `wave3-clock-gap-294`
**Timestamp**: 2026-03-14 11:23 EST
**Resolved**: 2026-03-14 11:30 EST
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Severity**: Medium

**Resolution**: Fixed migration tool bugs (underscore exclusion, missing layers, missing `datetime.datetime.utcnow()` pattern). Re-executed migration with 97 additional mutations. Reduced `uses_wall_clock` from 294 → 239 sites. Remaining 239 sites are primarily monotonic/performance clocks (intentional exclusions) plus ~120 `time.time()` sites requiring further investigation.

## Incident Summary

Wave 3 clock migration tool (`bulk_clock_migrator.py`) successfully migrated 996 sites but left 294 `uses_wall_clock` edges in the ADG. Investigation reveals the remaining sites fall into three categories:

1. **Legitimate unmigrated sites** (~166 `time.time()` calls) - Tool execution issue
2. **Monotonic/performance clocks** (~115 `time.monotonic()`, `time.perf_counter()`) - Should NOT be migrated
3. **Edge cases** (fully qualified `datetime.datetime.utcnow()`, `time.strftime()`) - Pattern gaps

## Root Cause

### Primary Cause: Incomplete File Scanning

The migration tool was executed but did not scan all Python files in the repository. Analysis shows:

- **Expected**: All `.py` files in production layers (L0-L6, L_APP)
- **Actual**: Tool scanned files but missed many containing `time.time()` calls
- **Evidence**: 166 `time.time()` sites remain, but tool pattern correctly matches `time.time()`

**Hypothesis**: Tool's file discovery logic may have excluded certain directories or files.

### Secondary Cause: Pattern Gaps

Tool patterns did not include:
- `time.monotonic()` - Intentional (should NOT migrate monotonic clocks)
- `time.perf_counter()` - Intentional (should NOT migrate performance counters)
- `datetime.datetime.utcnow()` - Unintentional (fully qualified form not matched)
- `time.strftime()` - Intentional (formatting, not time access)

### Tertiary Cause: ClockProvider Self-Reference

`ClockProvider.time()` implementation uses `time.time()` internally (line 78), creating a legitimate `uses_wall_clock` edge. This is correct but inflates the ADG count by 1.

## Impact

- **Determinism Coverage**: 66.5% reduction (878→294) achieved, but 166 legitimate sites remain unmigrated
- **Replay Safety**: Unmigrated `time.time()` calls prevent full deterministic replay
- **ADG Accuracy**: ADG correctly detects all clock usage, including monotonic clocks (which should not be migrated)

## Corrective Actions

### **Immediate** ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Created analysis script `query_remaining_clock_sites.py` to identify patterns
- [x] Categorized 294 remaining sites:
  - 166 `time.time()` - legitimate unmigrated (NEEDS FIXING)
  - ~100 `time.monotonic()` - intentional exclusion (CORRECT)
  - ~15 `time.perf_counter()` - intentional exclusion (CORRECT)
  - 6 `datetime.datetime.utcnow()` - pattern gap (NEEDS FIXING)
  - 7 other edge cases

**Evidence**:
- Created `tools/adg/query_remaining_clock_sites.py`
- Executed query showing 99 files with 294 total sites
- Pattern analysis confirms root cause

### **Short-term** ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Fixed `bulk_clock_migrator.py` to include fully qualified `datetime.datetime.utcnow()` pattern
- [x] Fixed tool to include files starting with underscore (`_ssot_*.py`)
- [x] Added L1 and L6 layers to migration scope
- [x] Re-ran migration tool - found 97 additional mutations across 35 files
- [x] Regenerated ADG - confirmed reduction: 294 → 239 sites (55 sites eliminated)

**Evidence**:
- Tool fixes: Added `datetime.datetime.utcnow()` pattern, removed underscore exclusion, added L1/L6 layers
- Execution: 97 mutations in 35 files (L0: 6 files, L1: 16 files, L4: 1 file, L5: 1 file, L6: 7 files, L_TOOLS: 4 files)
- ADG verification: `uses_wall_clock`: 294 → 239 (-55 sites, 18.7% additional reduction)
- Total Wave 3 progress: 878 → 239 (72.8% reduction, 639 sites migrated)

### **Medium-term** (Next session)

- [ ] Add ADG edge type filter: `uses_wall_clock_deterministic` vs `uses_monotonic_clock`
- [ ] Update scanner to distinguish wall-clock (needs migration) from monotonic (intentional)
- [ ] Document monotonic clock usage policy (when to use vs wall-clock)

## Preventive Measures

### **Process**
- [ ] Add dry-run verification step to migration workflows: compare tool-found sites vs ADG edge count
- [ ] Require pre/post ADG comparison in migration evidence files
- [ ] Add migration tool self-test: verify it finds known patterns in test fixtures

### **Technical**
- [ ] Enhance `bulk_clock_migrator.py` with:
  - File discovery logging (show which files scanned)
  - Pattern match logging (show which patterns found per file)
  - Exclusion list for monotonic/perf counters (explicit, not implicit)
- [ ] Add CI gate: `check_wall_clock_vs_monotonic.py` to enforce separation

### **Documentation**
- [ ] Document clock usage policy:
  - Wall-clock (`time.time()`, `datetime.now()`) → ClockProvider (deterministic replay)
  - Monotonic (`time.monotonic()`) → Direct use (elapsed time measurement)
  - Performance (`time.perf_counter()`) → Direct use (benchmarking)

## Lessons Learned

1. **ADG edge counts are ground truth** - Always compare migration tool results against ADG edge counts before declaring success
2. **Monotonic ≠ Wall-clock** - Not all time functions should be migrated; distinguish deterministic replay needs from performance measurement
3. **Fully qualified imports matter** - AST patterns must handle both `datetime.utcnow()` and `datetime.datetime.utcnow()`
4. **File discovery is critical** - Migration tools must log which files they scan to detect coverage gaps
