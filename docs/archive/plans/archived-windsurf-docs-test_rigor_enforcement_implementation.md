## Executive Summary

Created comprehensive enforcement system to ensure `.windsurfrules` §1 requirements are followed during ALL code generation. System provides pre-action gates, test-first protocols, and post-action validation to prevent code commits without deterministic tests.

## Components Created

### 1. Test Rigor Enforcement Skill

**Location:** `.windsurf/skills/test-rigor-enforcement/`

**Files:**
- `SKILL.md` - Skill definition and overview
- `pre_code_generation_gate.md` - MANDATORY pre-code checklist
- `test_first_protocol.md` - Test-first discipline enforcement
- `post_code_validation.md` - Post-code compliance verification
- `example_usage.md` - Complete workflow example

**Purpose:** Provides step-by-step protocols for enforcing testing requirements at each stage of code generation.

### 2. Python Validator

**Location:** `agentic_core/L5_safety/enforcement/test_rigor_enforcer.py`

**Classes:**
- `TestRigorEnforcer` - Main enforcement engine
- `TestCoverageRequirement` - Test requirement specification
- `ValidationResult` - Validation outcome with metrics

**Purpose:** Automated validation of test coverage and compliance with §1.12 (no test skipping).

### 3. Updated .windsurfrules

**Location:** `.windsurf/rules/.windsurfrules`

**Changes:** Added enforcement hooks to §1 TESTING & EVIDENCE:
```markdown
**ENFORCEMENT:** Use skill `test-rigor-enforcement` for ALL code generation.

**WORKFLOW:**
1. BEFORE code changes: `pre_code_generation_gate.md`
2. DURING code changes: `test_first_protocol.md`
3. AFTER code changes: `post_code_validation.md`

**VALIDATOR:** `agentic_core.L5_safety.enforcement.test_rigor_enforcer.TestRigorEnforcer`
```

## Enforcement Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Code-Generation Gate

**MANDATORY before ANY code changes.**

**Steps:**
1. Declare scope (files to be changed)
2. Identify changed surfaces (functions, classes, state transitions)
3. Specify required test coverage per §1.5 (edge cases)
4. Calculate minimum test count
5. Gate decision: BLOCK if requirements incomplete

**Output:**
```
SCOPE: 2 files
CHANGED_SURFACES: 3
TEST_REQUIREMENTS: 18 tests minimum
GATE STATUS: ✅ APPROVED
```

**Enforcement:** Code generation BLOCKED until test requirements declared.

### Phase 2: Test-First Protocol

**Enforces §1.2: Tests MUST exist before logic changes.**

**Steps:**
1. Write ALL required tests BEFORE implementation
2. Verify tests are deterministic (§1.3)
3. Verify edge case coverage (§1.5)
4. Verify fail-closed behavior (§1.8)
5. Run tests → ALL SHOULD FAIL (no implementation yet)
6. ONLY THEN write implementation
7. Run tests → ALL SHOULD PASS

**Enforcement:** Implementation BLOCKED until tests written and failing.

### Phase 3: Post-Code Validation

**MANDATORY after code changes.**

**Steps:**
1. Run `pytest --collect-only -q` (count collected tests)
2. Run `pytest -v` (count executed tests)
3. Verify collected == executed (§1.12)
4. Verify executed >= declared minimum (§1.1)
5. Verify no skip markers (§1.12)
6. Verify determinism (run tests 3x)
7. Verify no mock bypass (§1.4)
8. Generate validation report

**Output:**
```
POST-CODE VALIDATION REPORT

Test Execution:
  Collected: 18 tests
  Executed:  18 tests
  Passed:    18 tests

Collection/Execution Match: ✅ PASS (§1.12)
Coverage Match: ✅ PASS (§1.1)

VALIDATION STATUS: ✅ APPROVED FOR COMMIT
```

**Enforcement:** Commit BLOCKED if any validation fails.

## Constitutional Requirements Enforced

### §1.1 Zero-tolerance
- ✅ Every line of changed logic MUST have tests
- ✅ No exceptions

### §1.2 Test-first discipline
- ✅ Tests MUST exist before logic changes are committed
- ✅ If tests do not exist, write them first

### §1.3 Deterministic tests only
- ✅ No random inputs without fixed seed
- ✅ No time-dependent behavior without injected timestamps
- ✅ No external state

### §1.5 Edge cases are mandatory
- ✅ null/None/missing field
- ✅ empty input
- ✅ malformed structure
- ✅ boundary values
- ✅ unauthorized input
- ✅ stale state
- ✅ replay input
- ✅ dependency failure
- ✅ negative control path
- ✅ recovery path

### §1.8 Fail-closed and side-effect safety
- ✅ Invalid preconditions block operation
- ✅ No side-effects occur before block
- ✅ Mutation paths assert return values, exceptions, file writes

### §1.12 Zero-tolerance for test skipping
- ✅ Run ALL collected tests without selective skipping
- ✅ Fail HARD if any test is deselected or bypassed
- ✅ Report exact count of collected vs executed tests
- ✅ Treat collection/execution mismatch as CRITICAL FAILURE

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Adding New Validator

```bash
# Step 1: Pre-code-generation gate
# Declare scope and test requirements
SCOPE: agentic_core/L5_safety/validators/new_validator.py
REQUIRED_TESTS: 12 minimum

# Step 2: Test-first protocol
# Write tests BEFORE implementation
pytest tests/test_new_validator.py -v
# Expected: 12 failed (no implementation)

# Step 3: Write implementation
# Minimal code to pass tests

# Step 4: Post-code validation
pytest tests/test_new_validator.py -v
# Expected: 12 passed

# Step 5: Automated validation
python -c "
from pathlib import Path
from agentic_core.L5_safety.enforcement.test_rigor_enforcer import TestRigorEnforcer

enforcer = TestRigorEnforcer(Path.cwd())
result = enforcer.validate_post_code_generation('tests/test_new_validator.py')
print(enforcer.generate_validation_report(result))
"
```

### Example 2: Modifying Existing Logic

```bash
# Step 1: Identify changed surfaces
git diff agentic_core/L5_safety/enforcement/existing.py

# Step 2: Declare additional test requirements
EXISTING_TESTS: 8
NEW_TESTS_REQUIRED: 4 (for new edge cases)
TOTAL_REQUIRED: 12

# Step 3: Write new tests first
# Add 4 new edge case tests

# Step 4: Modify implementation
# Change logic

# Step 5: Validate
pytest tests/test_existing.py -v
# Expected: 12 passed (8 existing + 4 new)
```

## Integration with Cascade

### Before Code Generation

Cascade MUST:
1. Invoke `skill test-rigor-enforcement`
2. Read `pre_code_generation_gate.md`
3. Declare scope and test requirements
4. Wait for user approval before proceeding

### During Code Generation

Cascade MUST:
1. Write tests BEFORE implementation
2. Follow `test_first_protocol.md`
3. Verify tests fail initially
4. Write minimal implementation
5. Verify tests pass

### After Code Generation

Cascade MUST:
1. Run `post_code_validation.md`
2. Execute pytest collection and execution
3. Verify counts match
4. Generate validation report
5. BLOCK commit if validation fails

## Validation Gates

### Gate 1: Pre-Code (BLOCKING)

**Condition:** Test requirements declared
**Action if FAIL:** BLOCK code generation
**Override:** None (constitutional requirement)

### Gate 2: Test-First (BLOCKING)

**Condition:** Tests written before implementation
**Action if FAIL:** BLOCK implementation
**Override:** None (§1.2 requirement)

### Gate 3: Post-Code (BLOCKING)

**Condition:** All validation checks pass
**Action if FAIL:** BLOCK commit
**Override:** None (§1.12 requirement)

## Metrics Tracked

### Test Coverage Metrics
- Collected test count
- Executed test count
- Passed test count
- Failed test count
- Skipped test count
- Coverage gap (required - actual)

### Compliance Metrics
- Collection/execution match (§1.12)
- Coverage match (§1.1)
- Determinism verified (§1.3)
- Edge cases covered (§1.5)
- Fail-closed proven (§1.8)
- No mock bypass (§1.4)

### Violation Tracking
- §1.1 violations (insufficient coverage)
- §1.2 violations (implementation before tests)
- §1.3 violations (non-deterministic tests)
- §1.12 violations (test skipping)

## Enforcement Guarantees

### What This System Guarantees

✅ **Test requirements declared before code generation**
- Pre-code gate blocks until requirements specified

✅ **Tests written before implementation**
- Test-first protocol enforces §1.2

✅ **No test skipping**
- Post-code validation detects collection/execution mismatch

✅ **Edge cases covered**
- Pre-code gate requires explicit edge case enumeration

✅ **Deterministic tests**
- Test-first protocol includes determinism checklist

✅ **Fail-closed behavior proven**
- Test-first protocol requires fail-closed tests

### What This System Does NOT Guarantee

⚠️ **Cascade will follow the workflow every time**
- Cascade is an LLM with probabilistic behavior
- System provides tools, but cannot force usage
- See `RCA_windsurfrules_enforcement_gaps.md` for architectural limitations

⚠️ **Tests are high quality**
- System verifies test count and coverage
- Cannot verify test logic correctness
- Human review still required

⚠️ **100% code coverage**
- System verifies declared surfaces are tested
- Does not compute line-level coverage metrics
- Use `pytest-cov` for detailed coverage analysis

## Remediation for Violations

### Violation: Collection ≠ Execution (§1.12)

**Symptom:**
```
Collected: 18 tests
Executed: 15 tests
VIOLATION: 3 tests deselected
```

**Remediation:**
1. Invoke `pytest-integrity/conftest_hook_audit.md`
2. Locate all `conftest.py` files
3. Inspect `pytest_collection_modifyitems` hooks
4. Remove marker filtering or fix marker registration
5. Re-run validation

### Violation: Insufficient Coverage (§1.1)

**Symptom:**
```
Required: 18 tests
Executed: 12 tests
VIOLATION: Coverage gap of 6 tests
```

**Remediation:**
1. Review `pre_code_generation_gate.md` requirements
2. Identify missing test categories
3. Write missing tests
4. Re-run validation

### Violation: Test Skipping (§1.12)

**Symptom:**
```
Skipped: 3 tests
VIOLATION: Zero-tolerance for test skipping
```

**Remediation:**
1. Locate skip markers: `grep -r "@pytest.mark.skip" tests/`
2. Remove skip markers
3. Fix or delete incomplete tests
4. Re-run validation
