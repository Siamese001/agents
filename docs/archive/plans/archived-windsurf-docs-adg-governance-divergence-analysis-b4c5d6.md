## Executive Summary
The branches diverged at commit `1597b1138` on March 8, 2026, representing two parallel development tracks:
- **ADG**: Focused on pre-commit hooks and test governance enforcement
- **governance_hardening**: Focused on ADG feature enhancements (snapshots, diff, ownership, confidence, repair)

## Divergence Point
**Common ancestor**: `1597b1138` - "feat: Eliminate silent swallower anti-pattern - 640→0 violations"

3. `ea26ef38a` - **Fix ADG build**
   - Comprehensive dependency graph generation

4. `78ba9c827` - **ADG anti-pattern burndown**
   - 72 violations suppressed to 0 new

5. `e82ab8b1c` - **Phase 1-2 Anti-Pattern Burndown**
   - 1862→0 violations eliminated

## Impact Analysis

### Complementary Work
Both branches are **enhancing the ADG system** but from different angles:
- **ADG branch**: Governance enforcement and test compliance
- **governance_hardening**: Feature capabilities and analysis tools

### No Conflicts Detected
The changes appear to be **non-conflicting**:
- ADG branch: Pre-commit hooks, test policies, CI gates
- governance_hardening: New analysis modules, enhanced capabilities

### Integration Strategy
**Recommended approach**: Merge governance_hardening into ADG

#### Rationale:
1. **ADG has more recent commits** (March 10 18:17 vs 20:16)
2. **ADG includes governance hardening** that governance_hardening lacks
3. **governance_hardening adds new features** that complement ADG's governance focus
4. **Both branches target the same ADG system enhancement**

#### Merge Plan:
```bash
# On ADG branch
git checkout ADG
git merge governance_hardening
# Resolve any minor conflicts (unlikely)
# Test combined functionality
# Push merged result
```

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Merge governance_hardening into ADG branch
2. **Validation**: Run full test suite to ensure compatibility
3. **Cleanup**: Delete governance_hardening after successful merge
4. **Documentation**: Update ADG documentation with new enhancements

## Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: Changes are complementary and non-overlapping
- **Test coverage**: Both branches have comprehensive test coverage
- **Rollback**: Both branches have backup tags available

## Files Changed Summary
- **ADG branch**: 51 files, primarily CI/governance configuration
- **governance_hardening**: 8 files, primarily new ADG analysis modules
- **Combined**: Enhanced ADG system with both governance enforcement and advanced analysis capabilities

## Rules

1. Follow all constitutional rules and guidelines
2. Maintain compliance with established standards
3. Document all changes and decisions
4. Validate all implementations before completion
