# Eval Harness ADG MCP Replan

Recreate the eval-harness rectification plan with ADG MCP transport health as the first-class prerequisite: Codex must prove an open ADG MCP transport, not merely a healthy local backend, before execution waves claim ADG-backed closure.

> **plan_id discipline**: `plan_id` matches the filename stem `eval-harness-adg-mcp-replan-a71c9e`. Wave markers use `plan=eval-harness-adg-mcp-replan-a71c9e`.

## Context (SCQA)

- **Situation** - The proposed eval harness wraps the runtime spine at four seams: whole-spine replay, X1D judge calibration, L6 exhaust-to-corpus promotion, and X2 micro-evals. The repo already has partial assets for those seams: capability regression tooling, X1D panel runners, X2 validators, exit evaluation surfaces, and L6 flywheel components. The ADG backend is healthy through the repo-local handler path with snapshot `06082026_1212`, SQLite healthy, Redis healthy, and graph projection fresh.
- **Complication** - The exposed Codex ADG MCP transport is closed: `mcp__adg_sqlite.adg_runtime_info`, `adg_health`, and `adg_reopen_connections` return `Transport closed`. Local handler calls can prove backend health but do not prove the agent-facing MCP transport. The previous plan captured this as a caveat; this successor makes it a blocking W1 prerequisite.
- **Question** - How do we rectify the proposed eval harness gaps while ensuring ADG evidence comes from an open, agent-facing MCP transport or an explicitly marked degraded fallback?
- **Answer** - First reopen and prove Codex ADG MCP transport lifecycle, then use ADG to order the harness work: whole-spine replay, X2 micro-evals, X1D calibration trust, L6 corpus flywheel, and CI/UWG promotion binding.

## Transport State At Plan Creation

`mcp__adg_sqlite` transport status:
- `adg_runtime_info`: `Transport closed`
- `adg_health`: `Transport closed`
- `adg_reopen_connections`: `Transport closed`

Repo-local backend fallback status:
- `health.status`: `ok`
- `mode`: `full`
- `sqlite`: `healthy`
- `redis`: `healthy`
- `snapshot`: `06082026_1212`
- `sqlite_path`: `C:\Git\Agentic-Workflow-FRESH\artifacts\adg\adg_indexed_06082026_1212.sqlite`
- `graph_projection`: available and fresh
- `local reopen`: `reopened=true`, `noop=true`, because snapshot path and mtime were unchanged

Decision:
- Local handler health is acceptable only as `DEGRADED_FALLBACK`.
- W1 cannot be marked complete until the Codex-exposed MCP transport itself returns `adg_health` and `adg_runtime_info`.
- If Codex does not expose host-level MCP restart controls, W1 must document the required external restart path and prove it with changed PID/nonce.

---

## Out Of Scope

- Letting offline eval waive a live X2, X1D, X3, Exit, or UWG verdict.
- Replacing app-specific validators with one generic evaluator.
- Treating local SQLite reads as equivalent to an open MCP transport.
- Auto-promoting L6 findings into golden suites without review.
- Re-adding unrelated dormant MCP servers as part of this plan.

## Gap Register

**GAP-1: Codex ADG MCP transport is closed**
- Evidence: `adg_runtime_info`, `adg_health`, and `adg_reopen_connections` return `Transport closed`.
- Impact: agent-facing ADG evidence cannot be claimed even though local backend health is green.

**GAP-2: Backend health and transport health are conflated**
- Local handler reports full health, but the exposed MCP channel is dead.
- Impact: plans can overstate ADG availability unless evidence source is recorded.

**GAP-3: Whole-spine replay is not yet the harness runner**
- Existing regression flow scores stored fixtures rather than replaying the full runtime spine.
- Impact: promotion can pass without proving U0-to-L6 behavior.

**GAP-4: Baseline comparison is not structurally enforced**
- Proposed rig requires promotion blocked unless pass-rate and baseline criteria hold.
- Impact: absolute pass-rate can hide regressions.

**GAP-5: X2 micro-evals are not first-class**
- Validator edge cases exist in scattered tests rather than a named gate suite.
- Impact: fact-checker/gate regressions may not block promotion.

**GAP-6: X1D calibration metric semantics drift**
- Raw agreement and kappa thresholds appear in separate surfaces.
- Impact: stale or under-calibrated judges may count toward quorum.

**GAP-7: L6 exhaust-to-corpus is not end-to-end**
- Shadow eval findings do not automatically produce reviewable, trace-bound corpus candidates.
- Impact: repeated session failures are not reliably frozen into regression scenarios.

**GAP-8: Replay and exit disposition coverage are not ADG-visible enough**
- App spine adapters and exit surfaces have replay/disposition gaps in ADG evidence.
- Impact: harness seams cannot be proven structurally.
