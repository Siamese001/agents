# apps_qna — DAG Orchestration Enhancements (Routing + Paste-Set)

**Plan ID:** `apps-qna-dag-enhancements-e4c7b2`
**Owner:** apps_qna
**Status:** � Completed — all 5 waves landed (2026-05-02)
**Created:** 2026-05-02
**Scope tier:** T3 (cross-layer — apps_qna router + spine_adapter + templates + tests)
**Intent:** Evolve `apps_qna` routing from BoW cosine + coarse paste buckets to best-in-class Anthropic/OpenAI 2025 patterns (semantic routing, handoffs with shared memory, retrieve-rerank, graded outcomes, semantic cache) for live ChatGPT 5.5-Thinking Q&A card selection.

## Background

Current DAG (see parent review 2026-05-02):

```
[apps_research + apps_rg + JD + interviewer YAML]
  → [Interview model, frozen]
  → [route_seeding]
      ├─ Thompson bandit (cold-start n=5)
      ├─ BGE-M3 / keyword cosine
      └─ hand-curated fallback
  → [CardPackBuilder] ← AppsQnaPasteBandit (buckets: 8/12/18/25)
  → [22 markdown cards] → ChatGPT 5.5-Thinking Project (runtime)
  → [card 22 Learnings] → bandit.update_outcome(asked ∧ landed)  # Bernoulli
```

**Gaps identified** (10, ranked by impact):

1. Live-triage `SemanticRouter` is stdlib BoW cosine; seeding uses BGE-M3 — two embedding surfaces.
2. No small-LLM intent-classifier fallback when bandit + embedding both abstain.
3. Paste-bandit buckets {8,12,18,25} collapse evidence across heterogeneous paste shapes.
4. No cross-encoder reranker on the 9-route ranking.
5. No semantic cache for repeated rehearsal questions (operator probes same shape 8× across sessions).
6. Panel interviews don't share posterior evidence across interviewers.
7. "Max-context ≤3 cards" rule in card 01 is prose, not model-asserted at runtime.
8. Outcome binding is binary `asked ∧ landed` — loses graded signal from card 22.
9. No eval harness measuring route-classifier paraphrase-robustness.
10. Flywheel → Notion writeback is one-directional; cross-interview learning loop unverified.

**Design anchors:**
- Anthropic — *Building Effective Agents* (routing → specialist; LLM-as-judge at 1-2%)
- Anthropic — *Building Effective AI Agents: Architecture Patterns* eBook
- OpenAI Agents SDK — handoffs with shared memory; mid-run model escalation
- Sealos 2025 blueprint — classifier → vector retrieve w/ rerank → tool executor DAG
- vCache (arXiv 2502.03771) — per-question semantic-cache thresholds beat global

**Constitutional alignment:** §22 (graph-layer evidence), §29 (closed-loop router markers paired with ledger writes), §34 (retrieval budgets), ADR-050 (intelligence-ledger family — `apps_qna_pack_lifecycle`).

## Wave Structure

| Wave | Phase IDs | Focus | Est. Tokens | Assumptions | Status | Success Criteria |
|------|-----------|-------|-------------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| W1 | W1.1, W1.2 | Collapse BoW router → unified BGE-M3 path | ~6k | `spine_adapter.classify_section_topic` remains stable; no new dep | **Done (2026-05-02)** | `SemanticRouter.route` and `route_seeding.rank_routes_by_signal` share one embedding surface; all existing tests green; paraphrase pair ("tell me about a time you led architecture" vs "walk me through an architecture decision") lands on same primary route |
| W2 | W2.1, W2.2, W2.3 | Cross-encoder reranker + graded outcome binding | ~12k | `BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3` available via spine (`agentic_core.knowledge.retrieval.bge_reranker_adapter`); additive `update_graded` on spine `BetaPosterior` + `NamespaceBandit`, additive `score` kwarg on domain `update_outcome` | **Done (2026-05-02)** | Reranker pass logged as feature in `apps_qna_pack_lifecycle` (`event_kind=rerank_pass`, `mode=cross_encoder\|bi_encoder_passthrough`, `rerank_delta`); `update_outcome(score: float)` accepts 0..1 grade, emits §29 `event=graded_outcome` marker + `route_outcome_graded`/`paste_outcome_graded` ledger rows; Bernoulli path preserved for back-compat; Thompson posterior reflects graded evidence via `alpha += score; beta += (1-score)` |
| W3 | W3.1, W3.2 | Panel-shared namespaces + small-LLM intent-classifier fallback | ~10k | Haiku 4.5 / GPT-5-mini gated by env flag (off by default); panel hash stable across rebuilds | **Done (2026-05-02)** | 3-interviewer panel accumulates shared posterior while per-interviewer specificity preserved via prefix-disjoint `qna_panel_<hash>` vs `qna_signal_<hash>` namespaces; LLM fallback emits `ROUTER_DECISION: layer=L0 router=apps_qna_intent_llm …` + `apps_qna_pack_lifecycle(event_kind=route_select_llm_fallback)` ledger row on every invocation including env-gated abstains |
| W4 | W4.1, W4.2 | Finer paste-budget bucketing + rehearsal semantic cache | ~9k | Bucket function derives from `(panel_size, technical_depth)`; cache writes to pack_lifecycle ledger only, no new store | **Done (2026-05-02)** | Paste-bandit exposes `bucket_for(panel_size, depth) → int` with 8 canonical buckets; `choose_paste_set` accepts optional `(panel_size, depth)` kwargs preserving Bernoulli back-compat; `apps_qna.integrations.rehearsal_cache` detects same-shape questions via SHA-256 signature over normalized text; writes `cache_hit`/`cache_miss` rows to existing ledger; `warm_start_signal()` exported as bandit feed surface |
| W5 | W5.1, W5.2 | Route-purity runtime self-check + paraphrase-robustness eval | ~7k | ChatGPT 5.5-Thinking respects appended self-check directive; card 22 grep post-rehearsal extracts assertion | **Done (2026-05-02)** | Card 01 answer-shape tail emits `SELF_CHECK: route=<N> cards_loaded=[...]` trailer directive; card 22 Learnings has extraction table + pathology mapping; `apps_qna/tests/test_eval_route_robustness.py` measures route-stability across 9 routes × 2 paraphrases each (18 paraphrase questions, 27 total) under BGE-M3: **stability=1.000** far above the 0.80 floor; SLO.md row added |

**Total est. tokens:** ~44k across 5 waves, 11 phases.

| W3.2 | Small-LLM intent-classifier fallback | new `apps_qna/integrations/intent_classifier.py`, `apps_qna/router/route_seeding.py` (stage-3 wiring) | Static `_FALLBACK_ROUTE_ORDER` when bandit + embedding abstain | ~6k | **Done** |
| W4.1 | Dynamic paste-budget buckets | `apps_qna/router/paste_bandit.py` (`bucket_for` + `choose_paste_set(panel_size, depth)`) | Coarse {8,12,18,25} merges heterogeneous paste shapes | ~4k | **Done** |

## ADG_HOTSPOT_REPORT

| File | Layer | Archetype | Fan-in | Fan-out | Surface | Impact |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| `apps_qna/router/route_bandit.py` | apps_qna (app) | ORCHESTRATOR | 3 (seeding, flywheel, tests) | 4 (spine_bandit, spine_adapter, registry, uuid) | Execution + Observability | High — §29 paired emission |
| `apps_qna/router/paste_bandit.py` | apps_qna (app) | ORCHESTRATOR | 2 (builder, tests) | 3 (spine_bandit, spine_adapter) | Execution + Observability | High |
| `apps_qna/router/route_seeding.py` | apps_qna (app) | CENTRAL_DEPENDENCY | 4 (from_research_brief, builder, tests, flywheel) | 3 (spine_adapter, route_bandit, types) | Execution | High |
| `apps_qna/router/semantic_router.py` | apps_qna (app) | STATE_NODE | 2 (cli, tests) | 1 (route_registry) | Execution | Med — BoW-only |
| `apps_qna/integrations/spine_adapter.py` | apps_qna ↔ spine | CENTRAL_DEPENDENCY | 6+ (all router + builder) | spine primitives | Execution + State + Observability | Critical — shared embedding surface |

*Note: `apps_qna` sits above L0_routing as an app-layer consumer of spine primitives. Layer-multiplier heuristics from constitutional §23 apply to spine edges, not to apps_qna itself — impact ranking here reflects app-internal fan-in × graph-edge density.*

## ADG_GRAPH_LAYER_EVIDENCE

**Materialized views consulted (to be re-run before W1 kickoff):**

1. `mv_graph_reverse_dependency_hotspots` — confirm `spine_adapter.classify_section_topic` fan-in count before unifying router path (W1)
2. `mv_graph_chokepoint_bridges` — identify `route_bandit` ↔ `namespace_bandit` bridge edges; ensure W2.2 graded-outcome change doesn't break spine contract
3. `mv_hotspot_centrality` — rank `route_seeding` vs `route_bandit` vs `paste_bandit` by centrality to prioritize W-ordering

**Semantic edges required:**

- `flows_to` — from `route_seeding.seed_likely_questions_from_research` → `LikelyQuestionGroup` emission → `CardPackBuilder.build` (validates W2.3 reranker wiring surface)
- `emits_side_effect` — on `emit_pack_lifecycle_event` calls in both bandits (W2.2 must preserve §29 paired emission invariant)
- `reads_from` / `writes_to` — on `pack_lifecycle` ledger reads in W4.2 `rehearsal_cache` (confirm no write-read cycle within a single build)
- `resolves_callsite` — `classify_section_topic` callsites in `route_seeding` and (new) `semantic_router` (W1 parity check)
- `controls_flow` — cold-start threshold branch in `route_bandit.choose_routes_for_signal` (W3.1 must preserve)

**P-view cross-references:**

- `v_p0_*` — no P0 defects expected in apps_qna routers (confirm pre-W1)
- `v_p1_*` — check for P1s in `spine_adapter` that would block W2.1 reranker wiring
- `v_p2_*` — existing `log_and_swallow` / `broad_exception_catch` at `route_seeding.py:196-198` (already present — not introduced by this plan; W3.2 must match the same guarded-except pattern)
- `v_p3_*` — doc/style items only; address incidentally

## Constitutional §29 Paired-Emission Matrix

Every new router touchpoint must emit `ROUTER_DECISION:` marker + `emit_pack_lifecycle_event` in the same code path. Waves affecting this contract:

| Wave | Router name | layer | event_kind |
|------|-------------|-------|------------|
| W2.2 | `apps_qna_route_bandit` (graded) | L0 | `route_outcome_graded` |
| W2.2 | `apps_qna_paste_bandit` (graded) | L0 | `paste_outcome_graded` |
| W3.2 | `apps_qna_intent_llm` | L0 | `route_select_llm_fallback` |
| W4.2 | `apps_qna_rehearsal_cache` | L6 | `cache_hit` / `cache_miss` |

All must be captured by `post_cursor_agent_router_decision_audit.py`.

## Out of Scope (explicit)

- No runtime LLM call into ChatGPT — pack remains paste-into-Project workflow.
- No governance plane (UWG / L5 / Author-Gate at runtime) — offline builder stays offline.
- No new database / persistent store — all writes land in existing `apps_qna_pack_lifecycle` ledger + `pack_manifest.json`.
- No changes to the 22-card structure, filename convention, or the 6 linter invariants (LINT-1..6) — all card shape is preserved; only routing/ranking surfaces change.
- No API keys or network calls at build time unless W3.2 LLM fallback is explicitly enabled via env flag.

## Dependencies + Prerequisites

- ADG snapshot refresh (`/adg-redis-refresh`) before W1 kickoff.
- Verify `BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3` availability in spine vector_db path before W2.1.
- Confirm `NamespaceBandit.update` accepts fractional success weights before W2.2 (if not, W2.2 includes a thin shim).
- All waves assume `apps_qna_pack_lifecycle` ledger remains registered and functional (ADR-050).

## Rollback Posture

Each wave is a **net-add** by design:

- W1 keeps old `SemanticRouter` class signature; internal implementation swap.
- W2.1 new file; W2.2 additive signature (existing Bernoulli path preserved).
- W3.2 new file, env-gated.
- W4.2 new file; no changes to existing `pack_lifecycle` schema (new `event_kind` values only).
- W5.1 append-only to template; W5.2 new test file.

Rollback = revert the wave's commits; no schema migration, no data loss.

## Acceptance for Plan Close

- All 11 phases complete, green.
- `pytest apps_qna/` green.
- `python -m apps_qna lint <pack>` exits 0 on all existing canaries.
- Paraphrase-robustness metric (W5.2) reports ≥ 0.80 route-stability across 20-question perturbation sample.
- `post_cursor_agent_router_decision_audit.py` shows zero §29 emission violations across all new router touchpoints.
- Notion row for this plan updated to 🔵 Completed with on-disk commit SHA referenced.
