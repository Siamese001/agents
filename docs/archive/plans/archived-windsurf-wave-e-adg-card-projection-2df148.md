# Wave E — ADG Semantic Card Projection

**Tier**: T3 (cross-layer: tools/ingestion + agentic_core L3/L4 retrieval)
**ADG Snapshot**: 04222026_2022 (73,705 nodes, 546,404 edges) — healthy
**Parent Assessment**: `.windsurf/plans/adg-chromadb-retrieval-assessment-8a3f2b.md`
**Status**: Done (µW0–µW7 landed; three scope items deferred via DEFERRED_SCOPE markers)
**Execution Mode**: Micro-waves, one commit + push per µW

## Goal

Implement the **ADG → semantic card projection** layer that the 2026-04-06 assessment
recommended as the Option C foundation. Replace the raw-edge-bulk ingest
(`tools/ingestion/ingest_adg.py`, ~624k edge documents — the documented anti-pattern)
with a curated symbol / path / violation / hotspot card emitter that uses the already-built
materialized views (`mv_hotspot_centrality`, `mv_gateway_bypass_paths`,
`mv_graph_chokepoint_bridges`, `mv_dependency_cone_risk`, `mv_debt_concentration_hotspots`,
`mv_exemptions_near_critical_paths`) as truth.

## Wave Structure

|------|-----------|-------|-------------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| µW0 | E.0 | Plan file (this file) | 1k | — | Done | File exists at SSOT path |
| µW1 | E.1 | Card types + projector skeleton (`tools/ingestion/adg_cards/__init__.py`, `types.py`) | 2k | ADG SQLite readable | Done | Module imports clean; `SymbolCard`, `PathCard`, `ViolationCard`, `HotspotCard` dataclasses exist |
| µW2 | E.2 | Symbol + Hotspot emitters (`symbol_emitter.py`, `hotspot_emitter.py`) | 5k | `mv_hotspot_centrality` populated | Done | Emitters return non-empty iterables against live snapshot |
| µW3 | E.3 | Violation + Path emitters (`violation_emitter.py`, `path_emitter.py`) | 5k | `violations`, `mv_gateway_bypass_paths`, `mv_graph_chokepoint_bridges` populated | Done | Emitters return non-empty iterables against live snapshot |
| µW4 | E.4 | CLI entrypoint `tools/ingestion/project_adg_cards.py` + deprecation banner on `ingest_adg.py` | 3k | Card emitters stable | Done | CLI runs dry-run; prints counts per card kind |
| µW5 | E.5 | Unit tests for card shape + metadata invariants | 3k | pytest working | Done | 12/12 card tests pass |
| µW6 | E.6 | Stamp `adg_node_id` on code-chunk metadata in `ingest_code.py` | 2k | ADG resolved_path index available | Done | 10/10 chunks in live smoke resolve; 5/5 resolver tests pass |
| µW7 | E.7 | Writeback (memory entity + Notion row) | 1k | — | Done | Memory + Notion receipts present |

## Writeback Receipts

WRITEBACK: memory entities=`ProceduralPattern:ADGSemanticCardProjection`, `Project:WaveE-ADG-Card-Projection`

## ADG_GRAPH_LAYER_EVIDENCE

Primary graph-layer drivers for this work (constitutional §22):
- **Materialized views (≥3)**: `mv_hotspot_centrality` (hotspot + symbol cards), `mv_gateway_bypass_paths` (path cards), `mv_graph_chokepoint_bridges` (path cards), `mv_dependency_cone_risk` (hotspot boost), `mv_debt_concentration_hotspots` (hotspot), `mv_exemptions_near_critical_paths` (violation context)
- **Semantic edges**: `flows_to`, `reads_from`, `writes_to`, `emits_side_effect`, `controls_flow`, `resolves_callsite` — surfaced in symbol-card neighbor summaries and path-card hop descriptions
- **P-views cross-ref**: `v_p0_apps_direct_infra`, `v_p0_write_bypass_uwg`, `v_p1_mis_layered_infra` — consumed by violation cards to pre-classify severity

## ADG_HOTSPOT_REPORT

Not a refactor of existing hot code — this is a new ingestion module. Hotspot archetype applies to *output* cards:
- Every `HotspotCard` row classified into `{CENTRAL_DEPENDENCY, ORCHESTRATOR, STATE_NODE, SAFETY_GATEKEEPER}` based on fan-in/fan-out/layer.
- Surface intersection (5 ADG Surfaces: Execution, Write, Security, State, Observability) carried as a metadata field on every card.

## Commit Protocol

Per user directive: **each µW gets its own commit and push.**
- Commit message format: `wave-e µW<n>: <scope>`
- Only stage files authored in this work; unrelated dirty tree preserved.
- After each push, update this plan's Status column.

## Out of Scope (deferred)

- HybridSearchEngine wiring (ADG-seed + ADG-rerank) — depends on cards existing and deserves its own plan after E.6 lands.
- ADG Coverage Hardening Phase 0 from the parent assessment — orthogonal governance work.
- Deprecating `repo_adg_graph` collection deletion — this plan only adds the deprecation banner; removal is a later wave after benchmark proves cards dominate.
