## 🚀 USAGE AND INTEGRATION

### Running Individual Verifications
```bash
# Run provenance verification
python scripts/verify_adg_provenance.py --adg-dir artifacts/adg

# Run consistency verification
python scripts/verify_adg_consistency.py --adg-dir artifacts/adg

# Run trace/replay coverage
python scripts/verify_trace_replay_coverage.py --adg-dir artifacts/adg
```

### Running Full Verification Suite
```bash
# Run all blocking and non-blocking verifications
python scripts/run_adg_mandatory_verification.py --adg-dir artifacts/adg

# Run only blocking verifications
python scripts/run_adg_mandatory_verification.py --adg-dir artifacts/adg --non-blocking-only

# Run specific phase
python scripts/run_adg_mandatory_verification.py --adg-dir artifacts/adg --phase provenance

# Save comprehensive report
python scripts/run_adg_mandatory_verification.py --adg-dir artifacts/adg --output verification_report.json
```

### Integration with CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Verify ADG Authoritativeness
  run: |
    python scripts/run_adg_mandatory_verification.py \
      --adg-dir artifacts/adg \
      --output verification_report.json
    # Exit with non-zero code if blocking failures occur
```

## 📊 VERIFICATION RESULTS INTERPRETATION

### Status Classifications
- **✅ PASS**: All verifications passed - ADG is authoritative
- **❌ FAIL**: Blocking failures - ADG is not authoritative
- **⚠️ WARNING**: Non-blocking issues - ADG is authoritative but needs improvement

### Critical Failure Categories
1. **Provenance Issues**: Missing/inconsistent metadata across artifacts
2. **Consistency Issues**: Summary metrics don't match raw SQL queries
3. **Identity Issues**: First-party modules lack complete identity information
4. **Coverage Issues**: Critical execution surfaces lack trace/replay coverage
5. **Authority Issues**: Layer violations or UWG bypasses detected

### Metrics and KPIs
- **Trace Coverage Percentage**: % of modules with execution traces
- **UWG Compliance Rate**: % of write operations with UWG termination
- **Identity Completeness**: % of first-party modules with complete identity
- **Layer Authority Compliance**: % of edges complying with layer rules
- **Consistency Score**: % of metrics consistent across sources

## 🔧 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Verification Framework Design
```
Master Suite (run_adg_mandatory_verification.py)
├── Phase 1: Provenance SSOT (verify_adg_provenance.py)
├── Phase 2: Consistency (verify_adg_consistency.py)
├── Phase 3: Identity (verify_identity_completeness.py)
├── Phase 4: Trace/Replay (verify_trace_replay_coverage.py)
├── Phase 5: Layer Authority (verify_layer_authority.py)
├── Phase 6: L4 Normalization (verify_l4_normalization.py)
└── Phases 7-17: Specialized Verifications (pending)
```

### Data Flow
1. **Input**: ADG artifacts (SQLite, JSON snapshots, graphs)
2. **Processing**: Individual verification scripts with specific focus areas
3. **Aggregation**: Master suite collects and standardizes results
4. **Output**: Comprehensive report with status, metrics, and recommendations

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Blocking Errors**: Immediate failure, stop processing for critical issues
- **Non-blocking Warnings**: Continue processing, collect for final report
- **Graceful Degradation**: Missing optional fields generate warnings, not failures
- **Detailed Diagnostics**: Specific error messages with file/line references

## 📈 SUCCESS CRITERIA AND EXIT CONDITIONS

### Minimum Requirements for ADG Authoritativeness
✅ **COMPLETED**:
- [x] Provenance is fully consistent across all artifacts
- [x] Summaries equal raw SQL queries and exported reports
- [x] First-party identity is separated from external dilution
- [x] L4 has zero unknown first-party layer identity
- [x] Replay/trace coverage is measurable and enforced
- [x] Write paths prove UWG closure or are explicitly flagged
- [x] Layer authority violations are detected and reported

🔄 **REMAINING**:
- [ ] Scanner/test dominance is normalized out of runtime truth views
- [ ] Validation results are first-class graph entities
- [ ] Pass and fail signals both feed L4/L6/system learning
- [ ] Learning loop closure is provably queryable
- [ ] Exception/retry hygiene is explicitly classified and enforceable
- [ ] Runtime-semantic coverage ratios are tracked and trending upward

### Final Determination Question
**Before broad architecture/runtime remediation waves:**

> "Does this exact first-party execution path, under this exact code/policy/config snapshot, produce this exact trace, this exact validation result, this exact mutation envelope, and this exact learning consequence?"
