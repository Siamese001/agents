# apps_lic LinkedIn Qwen Refactor - Disable apps_research Delegation

Refactor the current `apps_lic` implementation into one live product path: drafting a LinkedIn recruiter outreach message from Amit through the existing canonical dispatch spine, with Qwen/vLLM as the primary provider and deprecated `apps_research` delegation blocked fail-closed.

> **plan_id discipline**: filename stem `apps-lic-linkedin-qwen-refactor-a9c4e2` == `plan_id`. Wave markers use `plan=apps-lic-linkedin-qwen-refactor-a9c4e2`.

## Context (SCQA)

- **Situation** - `apps_lic` already has a current implementation with a canonical product entrypoint, dispatch bindings, route profile, HOP pipeline, provider configuration, integration bridges, and tests.
- **Complication** - The current implementation is believed to still expose a deprecated R3R4 managed research path through `apps_research`, CLI auto-research behavior, generic/email defaults, and success-producing bridge/dispatcher shims. That conflicts with the intended live spine: `U0 -> L1 -> L0 -> C0 -> PA -> L3 -> L2 -> Exit`.
- **Question** - How do we refactor the current `apps_lic` code so the only live product path drafts LinkedIn recruiter outreach from Amit, while deprecated research requests become terminal R5 outcomes and no new runtime path is introduced?
- **Answer** - First review and receipt the current implementation, then remove live R3R4 research routing from canonical dispatch/L0/CLI, bound C0/PA/L3/L2 responsibilities, make Qwen/vLLM the primary generation provider, convert integration shims to fail-closed compatibility, and prove the behavior with focused tests, static checks, runtime receipts, and closeout evidence.

---

## Structured Reasoning Packet

SR_INTAKE:
- Objective: Refactor current `apps_lic` to one LinkedIn recruiter outreach draft path using the existing canonical dispatch spine.
- Constraints: no new app, no second runtime path, no bypass of `canonical_dispatch`, no live `apps_research`, no live R3R4 route, no L3 retrieval/execution/model/tool calls, no send/post/write side effects, no code edits before the review receipt exists.
- Assumptions: the listed files exist or have nearby current equivalents; Qwen/vLLM tests can use controlled stub behavior where configured; deprecated compatibility modules may remain importable but must not import or call `apps_research`.
- Tier: T3, because this crosses CLI, runtime dispatch, route contracts, bindings, config, provider behavior, integrations, proof artifacts, and tests.

SR_PLAN:
1. Establish read-only evidence and write `artifacts/apps_lic/current_apps_lic_refactor_review.md`.
2. Remove live deprecated research routing from canonical dispatch, route profile, L0, and CLI ingress.
3. Refactor bounded evidence, prompt assembly, provider defaults, L3 orchestration, and L2/HOP boundaries.
4. Convert bridge/dispatcher/quality-gate integrations into deprecated fail-closed shims.
5. Replace generic/email defaults with LinkedIn recruiter defaults and update output contracts.
6. Add and update tests for no live research imports, R3R4 blocking, manual R4 success, boundary discipline, provider settings, and LinkedIn output.
7. Run scoped pytest and static checks, then write `artifacts/apps_lic/current_apps_lic_refactor_closeout.md`.

SR_APPROVAL:
- This plan is ready for user approval before implementation. Execution must start with read-only review and receipt generation.

## Out Of Scope

- Designing a new `apps_lic` app or adding a second runtime path.
- Bypassing `apps_lic.runtime.dispatch.canonical_dispatch`.
- Re-enabling live web research or `apps_research` delegation under another name.
- Sending, posting, writing to LinkedIn, or committing durable L4 state from this workflow.
- Refactoring unrelated apps, shared governance rules, or `agentic_core` unless execution discovers a directly blocking contract mismatch.
- Inventing recruiter, company, role, referral, relationship, metric, application, salary, compensation, visa, or sensitive personal facts.

## Execution Details

### W0.1 - Evidence Preflight
**Scope**: Establish state and available governance tooling before touching implementation.

**Commands**:
```bash
git status --short --branch
git worktree list
python scripts/governance/verify_codex_primary.py
```

If available in the active surface, use ADG/Memory/GitKraken/Pytest MCP equivalents first. If unavailable in Codex, record the unavailable MCP and use the closest local script or CLI fallback.

### W0.2 - Current Code Review
**Scope**: Read the files named in the prompt and nearby current equivalents, with emphasis on actual live control flow rather than desired architecture.

**Required review topics**:
- Current live entrypoint and canonical dispatch flow.
- Current `apps_research` coupling points.
- Current R3R4 route behavior.
- Current CLI/wizard auto-research behavior.
- Current LinkedIn/email defaults.
- Current Qwen/vLLM model/provider declarations.
- Current HOP pipeline usage.
- Tests preserving deprecated behavior.
- Files to modify and tests to add/update.

### W0.3 - Review Receipt
**Scope**: Write `artifacts/apps_lic/current_apps_lic_refactor_review.md` before refactor edits.

**Required result**:
```text
artifacts/apps_lic/current_apps_lic_refactor_review.md
```

### W1-W3 - Refactor Execution
**Scope**: Make focused code/config/test edits in the current implementation only, preserving `canonical_dispatch` as the product entrypoint.

**Primary files in scope**:
```text
apps_lic/__main__.py
apps_lic/runtime/dispatch/canonical_dispatch.py
apps_lic/runtime/dispatch/stage_receipts.py
apps_lic/runtime/dispatch/runtime_proof_bundle.py
apps_lic/runtime/dispatch/spine_run_result.py
apps_lic/runtime/bindings/l0_binding.py
apps_lic/runtime/bindings/l1_binding.py
apps_lic/runtime/bindings/c0_binding.py
apps_lic/runtime/bindings/pa_binding.py
apps_lic/runtime/bindings/l3_binding.py
apps_lic/runtime/bindings/l2_binding.py
apps_lic/runtime/bindings/exit_binding.py
apps_lic/config/domain_contract/l0_route_profile.outreach_message.v1.json
apps_lic/config/hop_pipeline.py
apps_lic/config/outreach_schema.json
apps_lic/config/exit_rubric.yaml
apps_lic/prompt_assembly/templates/compact_recruiter_arc.yaml
apps_lic/integrations/apps_research_bridge.py
apps_lic/integrations/managed_workflow_dispatcher.py
apps_lic/integrations/briefing_quality_gate.py
apps_lic/engines/*
apps_lic/validators/*
.env.example
tools/vllm/README.md
tools/vllm/check_vllm.sh
tools/vllm/start_vllm_server_32b.sh
```

### W4.3 - Verification Commands
**Scope**: Run the prompt-requested tests and static checks.

**Pytest**:
```bash
pytest tests/apps_lic -q
pytest tests/governance -q
pytest tests/_apps_contract -q
```

**Static checks requested by prompt**:
```bash
grep -R "from apps_research\|import apps_research" apps_lic/runtime apps_lic/engines apps_lic/reasoning -n
grep -R "GovernedResearchRun" apps_lic -n
grep -R "ResearchRequest" apps_lic -n
grep -R "dispatch_managed_briefing" apps_lic/runtime apps_lic/engines apps_lic/reasoning -n
grep -R "AppsResearchBridge" apps_lic/runtime apps_lic/engines apps_lic/reasoning -n
grep -R "auto delegates to apps_research" apps_lic -n
grep -R "L3 apps_research support" apps_lic -n
grep -R "HopPipelineExecutor" apps_lic/__main__.py apps_lic/runtime/bindings/l3_binding.py -n
grep -R "linkedin_send\|connector_send\|external_http_post" apps_lic -n
```

On Windows/Codex, equivalent `rg` commands are acceptable if the exact grep command is unavailable, but the closeout must state the substitution.

---

## Gap Register

**GAP-1: Current code may differ from prompt assumptions**
- Verify every named issue in W0 before editing.
- If a named file moved or a behavior was already removed, record the current equivalent in the review receipt.

**GAP-2: Deprecated tests may encode desired backward compatibility**
- Some tests may intentionally protect import compatibility for old integration names.
- Preserve import compatibility where needed, but change success-producing behavior to fail-closed.

**GAP-3: Provider healthcheck may not be available in CI**
- Tests should distinguish production fail-closed behavior from configured test stub mode.
- Do not introduce external fallback generation.

**GAP-4: Static scans can produce false positives from deprecation prose**
- The hard no-import scans apply to live runtime/engines/reasoning imports.
- Compatibility shims may mention names in deprecation text only; closeout must explain allowed textual hits.

**GAP-5: HOP pipeline may currently mix stage intent and execution**
- Keep HOP execution in L2 only.
- If existing helper structure requires movement, document the boundary decision and test it.
