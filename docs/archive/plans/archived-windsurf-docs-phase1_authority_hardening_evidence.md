## Discovery Fix (Wave 1 RCA)
`conftest.py::pytest_collection_modifyitems` deselects all items that lack
`integration_full_deps`, `governance`, or `unit_min_deps` markers.
Fix applied: `pytestmark = pytest.mark.unit_min_deps` added to both test
files; `tests/agentic_core/L1_cognition` and `tests/agentic_core` added to
`pytest.ini` `testpaths`.
