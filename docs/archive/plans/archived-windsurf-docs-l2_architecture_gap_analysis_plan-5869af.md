## Executive Summary

The current Agentic-Workflow repository contains 190 agents across agentic_core (L0-L6 layers) and apps_* domains, but lacks the structured four-bucket L2 architecture specified in the technical mapping. Significant architectural refactoring is required to align with the intended design.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### agentic_core Structure (190 agents total)
- **L0_routing** (3 agents): RootCustomsAgent, SSOTFolderCleanupAgent
- **L1_cognition** (3 agents): ASTValidatorAgent, MetaLearningAgent, StrategicRecommendationAgent
- **L2_execution** (5 agents): EmbeddingSovereignAgent, SovereignMCPGatewayAgent, StructuredEngineAgent, SubAtomicRegistryAgent, ToolsmithAgent
- **L3_orchestration** (13 agents): CoverageAgent, DAGMutatorAgent, DagEngineAgent, DomainPlannerAgent, FissionManagerAgent, NervousSystemAgent, OrchestrationHandshakeAgent, SemanticGatekeeperAgent, StateManagementAgent, SubAtomicAgent, SubatomicHopAgent, UnifiedAgent
- **L4_state** (Limited agents): CheckpointManagerAgent, GravityStateAgent, PineconeSovereignAgent, CachedStateLedgerAgent
- **L5_safety** (85+ agents): Extensive validation, enforcement, and healing agents
- **L6_observability** (Limited agents): ObservabilityProbeExecutor, PerformanceAnalystAgentSimple, SovereignHealthMonitor

### apps_* Domain Structure
- **apps_lic** (38 reasoning agents): Campaign workflow, message architecture, compliance
- **apps_rg** (24 reasoning agents): Resume generation, ATS compatibility, content strategy
- **apps_shared** (9 reasoning agents): Infrastructure orchestration, shared services

## Four-Bucket L2 Structure Gap Analysis

### 1. Pre-commit Bucket (ASSEMBLY STAGE)
**Target Components (from mapping):**
- S0: System (hard-coded constitutions & invariants)
- I0: Instructional (identity & mixin behaviors)
- D0: Injections (semantic fences & tool constraints)
- C0: Dependency (RAG injected knowledge)
- U0: User Prompt (raw intent)

**Current State Gaps:**
- ❌ Missing dedicated Assembly Stage sandbox airlock
- ❌ No S0 System constitutions enforcement
- ❌ I0 Instructional mixins exist but not integrated into assembly pipeline
- ❌ D0 Injections not centralized or governed
- ❌ C0 Dependency injection exists but not structured for assembly
- ❌ U0 User prompt processing scattered across L1

### 2. Validation Bucket (L0/L5 Authority)
**Target Components:**
- L0 Routing: Central traffic control with classification, election, arbitration, dispatch
- L5 Safety: Risk classification, compliance, enforcement

**Current State Gaps:**
- ⚠️ L0 exists but lacks comprehensive routing authority
- ❌ Missing deterministic ruleset election
- ❌ No tool inventory arbitration
- ❌ L5 Safety extensive but not integrated with L0 routing decisions
- ❌ Missing policy hash correlation between layers

### 3. Execution Bucket (L2/L3 Core)
**Target Components:**
- L2 Unified Execution Core: PTC sandbox, initialization, execution, synthesis
- L3 Orchestration: Sequential handshake, conflict arbitration, tool coordination

**Current State Gaps:**
- ⚠️ L2 agents exist but lack unified PTC sandbox structure
- ❌ Missing initialization with lease verification and state freezing
- ❌ No universal write gateway enforcement
- ❌ L3 orchestration agents exist but lack sequential handshake protocol
- ❌ Missing confidence-tier healing subsystem integration

### 4. Healing Bucket (L6 Meta-learning)
**Target Components:**
- L6 Observability: Anomaly detection, RCA, pattern analysis
- Meta-learning Pipeline: Audit, telemetry, RCA, propose, validate, commit

**Current State Gaps:**
- ⚠️ L6 observability agents exist but limited in scope
- ❌ Missing comprehensive anomaly detection engine
- ❌ No structured RCA (Root Cause Analysis) pipeline
- ❌ Meta-learning pipeline exists but not integrated with healing
- ❌ Missing pattern analysis and optimization feedback loops

### Key Implementation Details

**Assembly Stage Composition:**
```python
@dataclass
class AssemblyPackage:
    s0_constitutions: List[SystemConstitution]
    i0_instructions: List[InstructionalMixin]

```

**PTC Sandbox Flow:**
1. **Initialization**: Validate signed plan, verify tool budget, freeze state
2. **Execution**: Enforce tool contracts, universal write gateway, structured stdout
3. **Healing**: Confidence-tier escalation, remediation dispatch
4. **Synthesis**: Aggregate outputs, validate schema, emit transcript

**Healing Tier Selection:**
- **LOCAL_AGENT** (confidence ≥ 0.75): Fast local healing
- **QWEN_VLLM** (0.40 ≤ confidence < 0.75): Mid-tier escalation
- **GEMINI_2_5_PRO** (confidence < 0.40): High-tier escalation

## Success Criteria

### Phase Completion Metrics

### Quality Gates
- All existing 190 agents remain functional
- New architecture passes comprehensive test suite
- Performance benchmarks meet or exceed current metrics
- Governance and compliance requirements satisfied

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Complexity**: Incremental implementation with backward compatibility
- **Performance**: Comprehensive benchmarking and optimization
- **Integration**: Extensive testing and gradual rollout

### Operational Risks
