# Agentic Core Static: Apps Customization Governance

Prevent apps_* leakage into agentic_core through U0 runtime_customization_package enforcement, app-owned contracts, and core-boundary validation.

---

## Context (SCQA)

**Situation** — agentic_core is the common governed runtime spine, but recent implementations have introduced app-specific bindings (apps_lic_l0_binding.py, apps_lic_exit_binding.py, apps_rg_l0_binding.py, apps_rg_exit_binding.py, etc.) directly into core layers. These bindings bypass the intended U0 customization path and hardcode app behavior in shared infrastructure.

**Complication** — App-specific code in core violates the "apps customize inputs, core enforces contracts" principle. Every hardcoded app branch creates coupling, prevents parallel app evolution, and makes core changes risky. The existing bindings are technical debt that must migrate to generic engines consuming app-owned profile refs.

**Question** — How do we enforce agentic_core app-agnosticism while preserving heavy apps_* customization capability through U0 runtime_customization_package and app-owned contracts?

**Answer** — Establish a five-layer governance stack (AGENTS.md, Rules, Skills, Workflows, Hooks/CI) that blocks app leakage at edit time, audits at commit time, and fails CI for violations, while providing clear migration paths for existing bindings.

- Deletion of existing bindings before migration path established
- New app creation (this plan governs architecture, not app onboarding)
- Changes to L4 storage schema or UWG write path mechanics
- Performance optimization of generic engines
- L7 auditability data model changes
- Cross-app dependency allowlist changes
- **apps_lic L1/L2/L3/C0/PA/U0 bindings** (strictly excluded from W5B P1)
- **apps_rg migration** (deferred to W5C or later)
- **apps_research v1/v2 consolidation** (deferred to dedicated future wave)

## Gap Register

**GAP-1: No systematic enforcement of agentic_core app-agnosticism** ✅ RESOLVED
- Previous state: AGENTS.md had high-level principles but no scoped enforcement
- Resolution: W1-W4 complete - 7 docs, 5 skills, 4 workflows, 6 scripts, 6 CI tests
- Status: Enforcement active via hooks + CI

**GAP-2: Existing app-specific core bindings are technical debt**
- Current state: apps_lic_l0_binding.py, apps_lic_exit_binding.py, etc. in agentic_core
- Impact: Core changes require app-aware testing; coupling prevents parallel evolution
- Addressed by: W5-W6 migration to generic engines + app profiles

**GAP-3: U0 runtime_customization_package path underutilized** ✅ RESOLVED
- Previous state: Some apps used U0, others hardcoded in core
- Resolution: W2 u0-app-customization skill + W3 app_runtime_package_scan.py + W4 test coverage
- Status: Package validation active

**GAP-4: No edit-time guardrails for core changes** ✅ RESOLVED
- Previous state: Developers could edit agentic_core without boundary awareness
- Resolution: W3 hooks.json + 5 governance scripts (core_write_guard, core_leakage_scan, receipt_required_guard, app_runtime_package_scan, boundary_receipt_validator)
- Status: Local enforcement active

**GAP-5: No receipt discipline for boundary-sensitive changes** ✅ RESOLVED
- Previous state: Core changes lacked mandatory classification and justification
- Resolution: W3 receipt_required_guard.py + receipt-auditor skill + W4 test_governance_receipts.py + w3_hardening_emergency_bypass_policy.md
- Status: Receipt validation active with bypass policy

## Rebaseline Receipt

**Plan rebaselined from W5 forward**: `artifacts/governance/governance_plan_rebaseline_w5_forward_receipt.json`

**Rebaseline Reason**: Scope constraint enforcement - W5B P1 strictly limited to apps_lic L0/Exit/L6 only

---

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1 — W0 Baseline Audit
**Scope**: Inventory existing governance and app-specific core bindings

**Commands**:
```bash
# List existing AGENTS.md and .windsurf/ governance
find . -name "AGENTS.md" -o -name "*.md" -path "./.cursor/rules/*" -o -path "./.cursor/skills/*" | head -50

# Scan agentic_core for app-specific literals
grep -r "apps_lic\|apps_rg\|apps_qna\|if app_id\|app_id ==" agentic_core/ --include="*.py" | head -50

# Identify existing binding files
find agentic_core -name "*binding*.py" | xargs ls -la
```

**Acceptance**: Complete inventory of existing bindings and governance gaps

### Phase 2 — W1 Add Governance Instructions
**Scope**: Create AGENTS.md hierarchy and Windsurf rules

**Commands**:
```bash
# Verify files created
cat AGENTS.md
cat agentic_core/AGENTS.md
cat apps_lic/AGENTS.md
cat apps_rg/AGENTS.md
cat apps_qna/AGENTS.md 2>/dev/null || echo "apps_qna/AGENTS.md optional"
ls -la .cursor/rules/agentic-core-static.md
ls -la .cursor/rules/agentic-core-glob-lock.md
ls -la .cursor/rules/apps-customization.md
ls -la .cursor/rules/boundary-audit-required.md
```

**Acceptance**: All 7 governance instruction files exist with complete content per §§6-9

### Phase 3 — W2 Add Skills and Workflows
**Scope**: Create SKILL.md files and workflow docs

**Commands**:
```bash
# Verify 5 skills + 4 workflows
ls .cursor/skills/core-boundary-audit/SKILL.md
ls .cursor/skills/u0-app-customization/SKILL.md
ls .cursor/skills/runtime-package-verifier/SKILL.md
ls .cursor/skills/receipt-auditor/SKILL.md
ls .cursor/skills/app-leakage-refactor/SKILL.md
ls .cursor/workflows/core-boundary-audit.md
ls .cursor/workflows/u0-customize-app.md
ls .cursor/workflows/pre-commit-agentic-cert.md
ls .cursor/workflows/migrate-app-binding-to-generic-core.md
```

**Acceptance**: All 9 skill/workflow files exist with complete content per §§10-11

### Phase 4 — W3 Add Hooks and Governance Scripts
**Scope**: Create hooks.json and governance Python scripts

**Commands**:
```bash
# Verify hooks.json syntax
python -c "import json; json.load(open('.cursor/hooks.json'))"

# Verify scripts exist and are importable
python -c "import tools.governance.core_write_guard"
python -c "import tools.governance.core_leakage_scan"
python -c "import tools.governance.receipt_required_guard"
python -c "import tools.governance.app_runtime_package_scan"
python -c "import tools.governance.boundary_receipt_validator"
```

**Acceptance**: All 6 hook/script artifacts exist and pass basic import

### Phase 5 — W4 Add CI Governance Tests
**Scope**: Create tests/governance/ test suite

**Commands**:
```bash
# Run governance tests
pytest tests/governance/ -v --tb=short

# Verify each test file
python -m pytest tests/governance/test_agentic_core_static_boundary.py -v
python -m pytest tests/governance/test_no_app_specific_literals_in_core.py -v
python -m pytest tests/governance/test_apps_runtime_package_contracts.py -v

- 37 binding-like files discovered
- 28 migration-scoped bindings identified
- 9 excluded with documented reasons
- `app_specific_core_binding_migration_plan_w5a.json` written
- apps_lic/apps_rg/apps_research scoped for migration sequencing

**W5B P1 — apps_lic Priority Migration (COMPLETE)**
- Scope strictly limited to: L6 Promotion, Exit, L0 Routing only
- Do NOT touch: L1/L2/L3/C0/PA/U0 bindings for apps_lic
- Do NOT touch: apps_rg/apps_research/apps_qna/apps_rfp bindings
- Execution order: P1a L6 → P1b Exit → P1c L0

### Phase 7 — W6 Post-Migration Negative Controls
**Scope**: Re-run and extend negative controls AFTER W5B P1 migration to prove enforcement still catches violations

**Important**: W4 already verified 17 negative controls before migration. W6 validates that post-migration governance still blocks violations.

**Commands**:
```bash
# Re-run negative control tests post-migration
pytest tests/governance/test_negative_controls.py -v

# Verify each violation type still blocked after migration
python tests/governance/attempt_violations.py
```

**Acceptance**: 5 violation attempts all caught by appropriate layer (hook/CI) after W5B P1 migration

### Phase 8 — W7 Final Governance Receipt
**Scope**: Write completion artifact and mark plan complete

**Commands**:
```bash
# Verify receipt exists and is valid JSON
python -c "import json; r = json.load(open('artifacts/governance/agentic_core_static_apps_customization_governance_receipt.json')); assert 'plan_id' in r"

# Run final verification
python ops_scripts/ci/run_contract_gates.py | grep governance
```

**Acceptance**: Receipt exists with all fields per §17; Notion status = Completed

---

## Rules

1. **AGENTS.md is single source of truth** — Core and app boundaries documented in scoped AGENTS.md files
2. **Always-on rule guards core edits** — Any agentic_core edit triggers boundary classification
3. **Glob rules enforce directory ownership** — agentic_core/** vs apps_*/** have distinct rules
4. **Skills provide procedural guidance** — Five skills cover audit, customization, verification, receipt, and refactor
5. **Workflows codify canonical paths** — Four workflows for boundary audit, U0 customization, pre-commit cert, and migration
6. **Hooks are local guardrails** — Exit code 2 blocks unsafe action; CI remains final authority
7. **Receipts required for core changes** — Every boundary-sensitive change produces receipt
8. **CI tests are enforcement** — Violations fail CI; no human override in automated gates
9. **Migration receipts for existing bindings** — Temporary adapters must carry migration exception receipts
10. **Generic engines replace hardcoded branches** — App-specific logic moves to app-owned profiles

---

## Implementation Commands

```bash
# W0: Baseline audit
grep -r "apps_lic\|apps_rg\|apps_qna\|if app_id" agentic_core/ --include="*.py" | tee artifacts/governance/baseline_leakage_scan.txt

# W1: Create governance docs (after drafting content)
python tools/governance/verify_agents_md_syntax.py

# W3: Verify hooks and scripts
python -c "import json; json.load(open('.cursor/hooks.json'))"
python tools/governance/core_leakage_scan.py --help

# W4: Run governance tests
pytest tests/governance/ --tb=short -q

# W7: Generate receipt and mark complete
python tools/governance/generate_governance_receipt.py --plan agentic-core-static-apps-customization-governance-a1b2c3
python tools/plan_lifecycle/wave_execution_state.py complete --plan agentic-core-static-apps-customization-governance-a1b2c3
```

- Do not delete existing bindings
- Create migration receipts first
- Create app profiles for route, Exit, cache, threshold configs
- Create generic engines where needed
- Verify each migration with tests

**Blocked Until**: N/A (cleared for execution)

---

## Rollback Strategy

If hooks are too aggressive:
1. Set `AGENTIC_CORE_GOVERNANCE_BYPASS=1` in environment to disable local hooks
2. CI gates remain active (bypass requires admin override)
3. Adjust rule triggers from `always_on` to `model_decision` for calibration period

If CI tests fail on existing code:
1. Add explicit migration receipts for grandfathered bindings
2. Mark as `TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER` with `migration_target_date`
3. Tests allowlist documented adapters only

If skills/workflows are incomplete:
1. Fallback to manual AGENTS.md consultation
2. Escalate to author-gate decision per constitutional §6

## Cursor Agent Alignment Checks

- All rules follow always-on or model_decision trigger discipline
- Skills follow SKILL.md frontmatter contract per AGENTS.md
- Workflows are actionable procedures, not just documentation
- Hooks exit 2 for blocking, log for advisory
- CI tests are deterministic and fail-closed
- Receipts provide audit trail for boundary-sensitive changes

## Section 1: Executive Summary

**This plan prevents apps_* leakage into agentic_core.**

The core architectural law is: **agentic_core is app-agnostic runtime infrastructure; apps_* customize behavior through U0 runtime_customization_package and app-owned contracts/profiles.**

Apps customize inputs; core enforces contracts.

**Allowed in agentic_core:**
- Generic contract-chain propagation
- Generic profile resolver (consumes app-owned refs)
- Generic route policy interpreter
- Generic GateMesh enforcement
- Generic Exit profile enforcer
- Generic UWG enforcement
- Generic L6 completed-run profile consumer
- Generic receipt/proof infrastructure
- Generic anti-bypass checks

**Forbidden in agentic_core:**
- apps_lic-specific route logic (e.g., hardcoded R4_MANAGED_DRAFT)
- apps_rg-specific route logic (e.g., hardcoded R5_FINAL_ASSEMBLY)
- apps_qna-specific route logic
- App-specific cache policy (e.g., final_draft_r1a_bypass)
- App-specific Exit gate IDs
- App-specific judge/eval thresholds
- App-specific forbidden send policy (e.g., hardcoded linkedin_send rules)
- App-specific consent/compliance policy
- App-specific L6 promotion logic
- Hardcoded app_id branches (if app_id == "apps_lic")
- Hardcoded apps_* route names in shared runtime
- Hardcoded app profile paths in common core

**Existing app-specific core bindings are tolerated only as temporary migration adapters with explicit receipts.**

Files like `agentic_core/L0_routing/apps_lic_l0_binding.py` and `agentic_core/runtime/exit/apps_lic_exit_binding.py` are classified as either:
- `TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER` — migration in progress, receipt required
- `CORE_APP_SPECIFIC_LEAKAGE` — technical debt, schedule for migration
- `GENERIC_READY` — already generic, no action needed
- `MIGRATION_REQUIRED` — must move to generic engine + app profile

**Final target state:** Generic core engines consume app-owned profile refs. No hardcoded app behavior in shared infrastructure.

---

## Section 2: Non-Negotiable Spine Laws

These laws govern the L0-L7 execution stack and are enforced by gates, hooks, and CI tests:

### Layer Boundaries

**U0 (Intake/Validation)**
- Validates and preserves, but does NOT route, retrieve, execute, assemble prompts, call models/tools, write L4, or learn
- Transforms external input to ValidatedRequest
- Emits runtime_customization_package as carrier only

**L1 (Cognition/Planning)**
- Plans but does NOT route with authority
- Proposes but does not enforce
- Emits intent, not execution

**L0 (Routing/Authority)**
- Emits exactly one RouteContract
- Interprets app-owned route profile generically
- No hardcoded app-specific route selection

**L3 (Orchestration)**
- Orchestrates only when execution_form = MANAGED_WORKFLOW
- Must NOT reroute, retrieve directly, execute, approve output, write L4, or learn
- Enforces plan fidelity, not outcome validity

**L2 (Execution)**
- Executes bounded packets
- May emit proposed_state_diff only
- Must NOT commit durable state
- Fail-soft on bounded execution failure

**Exit (Evaluation/X3)**
- Emits exactly one X3 disposition
- Consumes app-owned Exit profile
- Enforces generic GateMesh law
- No app-specific gate IDs hardcoded

**UWG (Unit of Work Governance)**
- Is the ONLY durable write admission path
- Validates CommitRequest against app-owned write policy
- No bypass paths permitted

**L4 (State)**
- Stores durable truth only after UWG
- No direct writes from apps_*, L2, L3, Exit, or L6

**L6 (System Learning)**
- Learns only after the current-run boundary
- Outputs future-run proposals only
- No immediate-run influence

### GateVerdict Semantics

- **UNKNOWN is never PASS** — Unknown verdict does not clear the gate
- **NOT_APPLICABLE requires a reason** — NA verdict must include applicability rationale
- **Missing applicable GateVerdict is UNKNOWN, not PASS** — Absence of verdict is not clearance

## Section 4: Windsurf Enforcement Layers

### Layer 1: AGENTS.md

| File | Scope |
|------|-------|
| `AGENTS.md` (root) | Global architecture law: core is app-agnostic, apps customize via U0 |
| `agentic_core/AGENTS.md` | Core boundary rules: allowed/forbidden patterns per layer |
| `apps_lic/AGENTS.md` | App customization rules: what apps_lic owns and must provide |
| `apps_rg/AGENTS.md` | App customization rules: what apps_rg owns and must provide |
| `apps_qna/AGENTS.md` | App customization rules: what apps_qna owns and must provide (if exists) |

### Layer 2: Windsurf Rules

| Rule | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `agentic-core-static.md` | always_on | Core static in app behavior; classify all core edits |
| `agentic-core-glob-lock.md` | globs: agentic_core/** | Require generic justification + boundary receipt |
| `apps-customization.md` | globs: apps_*/** | App-specific behavior belongs here |
| `boundary-audit-required.md` | model_decision or manual | Trigger when core changed or app literals appear |

### Layer 3: Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `core-boundary-audit` | List changed files, classify each, scan core, write receipt |
| `u0-app-customization` | Audit app contracts, add/update U0 package, add profile refs |
| `runtime-package-verifier` | Verify package refs, digest, schema, field map reach |
| `receipt-auditor` | Verify receipt exists, changed files, tests, gaps |
| `app-leakage-refactor` | Detect core leakage, move to app profiles, add migration receipt |

### Layer 4: Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `/core-boundary-audit` | Git diff → classify → scan → write receipt → block if leakage |
| `/u0-customize-app` | App audit → package update → profile refs → schema → tests → receipt |
| `/pre-commit-agentic-cert` | Run governance tests → static scan → validate receipts → no bypass |
| `/migrate-app-binding-to-generic-core` | Identify binding → extract policy → generic engine → replace → prove → receipt |

### Layer 5: Hooks and CI

| Hook | Script | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `pre_write_code` | `core_write_guard.py` | Block core edits without receipt |
| `post_write_code` | `core_leakage_scan.py` | Scan for app-specific literals |
| `pre_run_command` | `receipt_required_guard.py` | Block broad commands without receipt |
| `post_cursor_agent_response` | `app_runtime_package_scan.py` | Check U0 package completeness |

**Hook law:** Exit code 2 blocks unsafe action; hooks are local guardrails, not final authority; CI remains final authority.

## Section 6: Root AGENTS.md Content (Proposed)

```markdown
# Agentic Core Architecture Law

## Principle: Core is App-Agnostic

agentic_core is the common governed runtime spine. It must remain **app-agnostic** — it knows apps exist, but does not hardcode app-specific behavior.

## Principle: Apps Customize Through U0

apps_* customize behavior through:
- U0 runtime_customization_package (carrier only, no routing logic)
- App-owned contracts (JSON schema, field map)
- App-owned config/profile refs (route, cache, Exit, gate, judge, write, learning)
- App-owned tests and receipts

## Principle: Core Enforces Contracts Generically

agentic_core may change only for **generic runtime infrastructure** that applies across all apps_*:
- Generic contract-chain propagation
- Generic profile resolver (consumes app-owned refs)
- Generic route policy interpreter
- Generic GateMesh enforcement
- Generic Exit profile enforcer
- Generic UWG enforcement
- Generic L6 completed-run profile consumer
- Generic receipt/proof infrastructure
- Generic anti-bypass checks

## Anti-Pattern: App-Specific Code in Core

App-specific behavior in shared agentic_core is **leakage**, not architecture. The following are forbidden:

- `if app_id == "apps_lic"` branches
- Hardcoded `apps_lic`, `apps_rg`, `apps_qna` route logic
- App-specific cache policy (e.g., `final_draft_r1a_bypass`)
- App-specific Exit gate IDs
- App-specific judge/eval thresholds
- App-specific forbidden send policy
- App-specific consent/compliance policy
- App-specific L6 promotion logic
- Hardcoded app profile paths in common core

## Exception: Temporary Thin Adapters

Existing app-specific core bindings (e.g., `apps_lic_l0_binding.py`) are tolerated only as:
- **TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER** with migration receipt
- Explicit `migration_target_date` in receipt
- Documented plan to move to generic engine + app profile

## Enforcement

- AGENTS.md (this file) is the single source of truth
- Scoped AGENTS.md in agentic_core/ and apps_*/ provide detailed rules
- Windsurf rules enforce at edit time
- CI governance tests enforce at commit time
- Receipts required for all boundary-sensitive changes
```

---

## Section 7: agentic_core/AGENTS.md Content (Proposed)

```markdown
# Agentic Core Boundary Rules

## Allowed in agentic_core

### Generic Infrastructure (Always Permitted)

- **Generic resolver**: Profile resolution from app-owned refs
- **Generic route interpreter**: RouteContract emission from route profile
- **Generic Exit enforcer**: X3 disposition from Exit profile
- **Generic L6 consumer**: Completed-run profile ingestion
- **Generic UWG enforcement**: CommitRequest validation
- **Generic GateMesh enforcement**: Gate dependency and consensus
- **Generic contract propagation**: Contract chain through layers

### App References (Permitted with Generic Interpretation)

- `app_id` as opaque string key
- App-owned profile refs resolved at runtime
- App-owned schema refs for validation
- App-owned policy refs for enforcement

## Forbidden in agentic_core

### Hardcoded App Behavior (Never Permitted)

- `if app_id == "apps_lic"` or similar branches
- `if app_id == "apps_rg"` or similar branches
- `if app_id == "apps_qna"` or similar branches
- Hardcoded `apps_lic`, `apps_rg`, `apps_qna` literals in logic
- Hardcoded app-specific route names (e.g., `R4_MANAGED_DRAFT`, `R5_FINAL_ASSEMBLY`)

### App-Specific Policy (Never Permitted)

- App-specific cache bypass rules (e.g., `final_draft_r1a_bypass`, `final_draft_r1b_bypass`)
- App-specific gate IDs in GateMesh
- App-specific thresholds in eval
- App-specific forbidden send lists (e.g., hardcoded `linkedin_send`, `email_outbox_send` blocks)
- App-specific consent/compliance policy enforcement
- App-specific L6 promotion policies

### Direct App State Access (Never Permitted)

- Hardcoded app profile paths
- Direct reading of app-specific config files
- Bypassing U0 package for app customization

## Migration Path

Existing violations must be classified:
- `TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER`: Migration in progress, receipt required
- `CORE_APP_SPECIFIC_LEAKAGE`: Technical debt, schedule for migration
- `GENERIC_READY`: Already generic, no action needed
- `MIGRATION_REQUIRED`: Move to generic engine + app profile
```

---

## Section 8: apps_*/AGENTS.md Template (Proposed)

```markdown
# {{APP_NAME}} Customization Rules

## Ownership

apps_{{app_short}} owns:
- App ingress contract (JSON schema, field map)
- runtime_customization_package (route, cache, Exit, gate, judge, write, learning refs)
- Route profile (route ID selection, fallback chains)
- Retrieval profile (R1a/R1b/C0 config, depth, sources)
- Prompt profile (assembly, few-shot, templates)
- Cache policy (exact, semantic, reuse rules)
- Runtime gate profile (G21/G22/G23 enablement)
- Exit profile (gate IDs, eval rubric, HITL policy)
- Judge/eval/rubric profiles (grader configs, dimensions, thresholds)
- Threshold profiles (pass/fail/escalate thresholds)
- Forbidden action/send policy
- Consent/compliance policy
- Write policy
- Learning/meta-feedback profile
- App tests and receipts

## Prohibited

apps_{{app_short}} must NOT:
- Implement separate Exit layer (only Exit profile)
- Emit X3 disposition (only Exit consumes Exit profile, emits X3)
- Write L4 durable state directly (must pass Exit X3C -> CommitRequest -> UWG -> L4)
- Directly send or perform forbidden side effects (must route through governed spine)
- Bypass U0 runtime_customization_package for behavior customization

## Integration Path

apps_{{app_short}} behavior enters agentic_core through:
1. U0 runtime_customization_package (validated and preserved)
2. Generic core resolver (consumes package refs)
3. Generic route interpreter (emits RouteContract)
4. Generic Exit enforcer (consumes Exit profile, enforces gate mesh)
5. UWG (admits writes per app-owned write policy)

## Receipts

All app customization changes should produce receipts documenting:
- Changed files
- Profile refs updated
- Tests covering changes
- Known gaps or migration exceptions
```

## Section 9: Windsurf Rules Content (Proposed)

### A. agentic-core-static.md (always_on)

# Agentic Core Static in App Behavior

agentic_core must remain app-agnostic. Before any core edit, classify:
- Generic runtime infrastructure (allowed)
- App-specific behavior (forbidden — belongs in apps_*)

## Classification Questions

1. Does this change apply to all apps_*? → Generic, allowed
2. Does this change hardcode app_id branches? → App-specific, forbidden
3. Does this change hardcode app-specific route/policy? → App-specific, forbidden
4. Does this change add app literals (apps_lic, apps_rg, apps_qna)? → App-specific, forbidden

## Required Actions

If core change classified as generic:
- Proceed with edit
- Document in change log

If core change classified as app-specific:
- STOP
- Move behavior to apps_* config/profile
- Refactor core to generic engine consuming profile
- Write migration receipt
```

# Agentic Core Edit Gate

Before editing agentic_core/** files:

## Required

1. **Generic justification**: Explain how change applies to all apps_*
2. **Boundary receipt**: Receipt file at .windsurf/receipts/agentic_core_<timestamp>.json

## Receipt Contents

- changed_files: List of agentic_core files
- classification: "generic_infrastructure" | "temporary_adapter" | "app_specific_leakage"
- justification: Why this is generic (or why adapter is temporary)
- tests: List of tests covering change
- gaps: Known gaps or migration items

## Prohibited Without Receipt

Any core edit without receipt requires Author-Gate approval per constitutional §6.

# Apps Customization Path

App-specific behavior belongs in apps_*/ directories.

## Correct Customization

- Add/update runtime_customization_package
- Add app-owned profile refs (route, cache, Exit, gate, judge, write, learning)
- Update app JSON schema and field map
- Add app tests and receipts

## Incorrect (Core Leakage)

- Modifying agentic_core for app-specific behavior
- Hardcoding app behavior in shared runtime
- Bypassing U0 package for customization

## Verification

After customization, run:
```bash
python tools/governance/app_runtime_package_scan.py --app <app_name>
```
```

# Boundary Audit Required

Trigger this skill when:
- Cursor Agent detects agentic_core files changed
- App-specific literals appear in core context
- app_id branching patterns detected
- Hardcoded app behavior suspected

## Procedure

1. Run `/core-boundary-audit` workflow
2. List changed files
3. Classify each change
4. Scan for forbidden app-specific literals
5. Decide: ALLOW | ALLOW_WITH_GENERIC_REFACTOR | BLOCK_MOVE_TO_APPS_CONFIG | BLOCK_ROLLBACK_REQUIRED
6. Write receipt documenting decision

# Core Boundary Audit

## Purpose
Audit agentic_core changes for app-agnosticism compliance.

## Procedure

1. **List changed files**
   - `git diff --name-only agentic_core/`
   - Categorize by layer (L0, L1, L2, L3, Exit, UWG, L6)

2. **Classify each file**
   - Generic infrastructure: allowed
   - Temporary thin adapter: allowed with receipt
   - App-specific leakage: requires migration

3. **Scan core for forbidden literals**
   - `apps_lic`, `apps_rg`, `apps_qna`
   - `if app_id`, `app_id ==`
   - App-specific route names (R4_MANAGED_DRAFT, etc.)
   - App-specific cache bypass (final_draft_r1a_bypass, etc.)
   - App-specific send policies (linkedin_send, etc.)

4. **Decide**
   - `ALLOW`: Change is generic infrastructure
   - `ALLOW_WITH_GENERIC_REFACTOR`: Change is mostly generic, minor refactor needed
   - `BLOCK_MOVE_TO_APPS_CONFIG`: Change is app-specific, move to apps_* config
   - `BLOCK_ROLLBACK_REQUIRED`: Change is leakage, rollback and redo via apps_*

5. **Write receipt**
   - Document classification, decision, tests, gaps
```

3. **Preserve U0 as carrier only**
   - U0 validates and preserves
   - No routing logic in U0
   - No app-specific execution in U0

4. **Add profile refs and digests**
   - Each ref has corresponding file
   - Each ref has package_digest for integrity

5. **Update schema and field map**
   - JSON schema covers all package fields
   - Field map connects external to canonical

6. **Add tests**
   - Package validation tests
   - Profile resolution tests
   - End-to-end reach tests

7. **Run boundary audit**
   - Confirm no core leakage
   - Write receipt

# App Leakage Refactor

## Purpose
Move app-specific logic from agentic_core to apps_* profiles.

## Procedure

1. **Detect app-specific logic in core**
   - Find hardcoded app_id branches
   - Find app-specific literals
   - Find app-specific policy

2. **Move behavior to apps_* profile/config**
   - Extract route policy to apps_*/config/domain_contract/route_profile.yaml
   - Extract cache policy to apps_*/config/domain_contract/cache_policy.yaml
   - Extract Exit profile to apps_*/config/domain_contract/exit_profile.yaml
   - Extract gate policy to apps_*/config/domain_contract/runtime_gate_profile.yaml

3. **Replace core logic with generic interpreter**
   - Update resolver to consume profile
   - Remove hardcoded branches
   - Add runtime profile lookup

4. **Add migration receipt**
   - Document original and new locations
   - Record test verification
   - Set migration_target_date if remaining work

## Example

Before:
```python
if app_id == "apps_lic":
    route = Route.R4_MANAGED_DRAFT
else:
    route = Route.DEFAULT
```

After:
```python
route_profile = resolve_profile(context.route_profile_ref)
route = route_profile.select_route(context)
```
```

### /core-boundary-audit

```markdown
# Core Boundary Audit Workflow

## When to Run
- Before committing agentic_core changes
- When app-specific patterns detected in core
- As part of PR review

## Steps

1. Run git diff
   ```bash
   git diff agentic_core/ > /tmp/core_diff.patch
   ```

2. List changed files
   ```bash
   git diff --name-only agentic_core/
   ```

3. Classify core changes
   - Generic infrastructure: proceed
   - Temporary adapter: verify receipt
   - App-specific leakage: stop, refactor

4. Scan for app-specific leakage
   ```bash
   python tools/governance/core_leakage_scan.py
   ```

5. Write receipt
   ```bash
   python tools/governance/boundary_receipt_validator.py --write-receipt
   ```

6. Block if leakage found
   - Exit code 2
   - Log violation
   - Suggest refactor path
```

### Hook Law

- **Exit code 2** blocks unsafe action
- **Hooks are local guardrails**, not final authority
- **CI remains final authority** — hooks can be bypassed locally, CI cannot

---

## Section 13: Governance Scripts Specification

### core_write_guard.py

**Purpose**: Blocks edits to agentic_core unless allowed

**Behavior**:
- Check if path is allowlisted generic core infrastructure
- Check if boundary receipt exists for changed files
- Allow TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER edits only if migration exception active
- Exit 0: allowed
- Exit 2: blocked with reason

**Allowlist**:
- Generic resolvers in agentic_core/config/
- Generic engines in agentic_core/L*/
- Base contracts in agentic_core/L_CONTRACTS/
- Framework code in agentic_core/utils/
- Migration receipts in .windsurf/receipts/

### core_leakage_scan.py

**Purpose**: Scans agentic_core for forbidden app-specific literals

**Forbidden patterns**:
- `apps_lic`, `apps_rg`, `apps_qna` (outside test fixtures and migration receipts)
- `if app_id` branches
- `app_id ==` comparisons
- `R4_MANAGED_DRAFT`, `R3R4_MANAGED_RESEARCH_THEN_DRAFT`
- `final_draft_r1a_bypass`, `final_draft_r1b_bypass`
- `linkedin_send`, `email_outbox_send`
- App-specific G21/G22 profile lists hardcoded in core

**Allowlist**:
- Generic test fixtures with documented purpose
- Migration receipts with explicit exception
- Generic app_id string handling (not branching)

### receipt_required_guard.py

**Purpose**: Blocks running broad implementation commands after core changes without receipt

**Behavior**:
- Check for agentic_core changes in recent edits
- Check if boundary receipt exists
- Permit read-only commands and tests (exit 0)
- Block implementation commands without receipt (exit 2)

**Permitted without receipt**:
- `pytest`, `python -m pytest`
- `git status`, `git diff`
- `python tools/governance/*`

**Blocked without receipt**:
- `python -m apps_*`
- `python tools/implement*`
- `python ops_scripts/ci/*` (except in CI context)

### app_runtime_package_scan.py

**Purpose**: Checks each apps_* has valid runtime_customization_package

**Behavior**:
- Scan apps_*/config/ for runtime_customization_package.yaml or equivalent
- Check package has required refs (route, cache, Exit, runtime gate, judge/eval, write, learning)
- Check package has package_digest
- Flag apps without package or with incomplete refs
- Write report to artifacts/governance/app_runtime_packages.json

### boundary_receipt_validator.py

**Purpose**: Validates receipt schema and required fields

**Schema validation**:
- receipt_version: "1.0"
- created_at: ISO8601
- changed_files: non-empty list
- classification: enum
- justification: non-empty string
- tests: list of commands
- known_gaps: list of {description, plan}
- migration_target_date: ISO8601 or null

**Validation rules**:
- If classification == "temporary_adapter", migration_target_date required
- If classification == "app_specific_leakage", remediation required
- tests must be non-empty for generic_infrastructure
- known_gaps must be empty or all have plans

---

## Section 14: CI Governance Tests Specification

### test_agentic_core_static_boundary.py

**Purpose**: Enforces no app-specific business policy in shared core

**Tests**:
- `test_no_app_specific_route_logic_in_l0` — L0 routing is generic
- `test_no_app_specific_cache_policy_in_core` — Cache policy is profile-driven
- `test_no_app_specific_exit_gates_in_core` — Exit gates are profile-driven
- `test_no_app_id_branching_in_generic_runtime` — No if app_id branches
- `test_app_specific_literals_blocked_outside_adapters` — App literals only in adapters

### test_no_app_specific_literals_in_core.py

**Purpose**: Scans core for forbidden terms

**Tests**:
- `test_no_apps_lic_literal_outside_allowlist`
- `test_no_apps_rg_literal_outside_allowlist`
- `test_no_apps_qna_literal_outside_allowlist`
- `test_no_r4_managed_draft_hardcoded`
- `test_no_final_draft_bypass_hardcoded`
- `test_allowlist_is_explicit` — Allowlist entries documented

### test_apps_runtime_package_contracts.py

**Purpose**: Each apps_* package has required refs and validates

**Tests**:
- `test_apps_lic_has_runtime_package` — Package exists
- `test_apps_rg_has_runtime_package` — Package exists
- `test_package_has_required_refs` — All 7 refs present
- `test_package_has_valid_digest` — Digest algorithm + match
- `test_package_schema_validates` — JSON schema passes
- `test_package_reaches_validated_request` — U0 passes through

### test_no_direct_l4_write_bypass.py

**Purpose**: No direct L4 writes from apps or internal layers

**Tests**:
- `test_apps_cannot_import_l4_write_apis` — Import restriction
- `test_l2_cannot_write_durable_state` — L2 emits proposed_state_diff only
- `test_l3_cannot_write_durable_state` — L3 orchestrates only
- `test_exit_cannot_write_durable_state` — Exit emits X3 only
- `test_l6_cannot_write_durable_state` — L6 learns post-run only
- `test_durable_write_requires_exit_x3c` — Path: Exit X3C -> CommitRequest -> UWG -> L4

### test_no_app_exit_x3_emission.py

**Purpose**: Only Exit emits X3

**Tests**:
- `test_apps_cannot_emit_x3` — apps_* have no X3 emission
- `test_only_exit_emits_x3` — agentic_core/exit/ only place
- `test_app_exit_profiles_are_data` — Exit profiles are YAML, not code
- `test_app_cannot_bypass_exit` — No direct CommitRequest from apps

## Section 15: Migration Policy for Existing App-Specific Core Bindings

### Existing Bindings Inventory

| File | Location | Classification | Migration Target |
|------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| apps_lic_l0_binding.py | agentic_core/L0_routing/ | TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER | Generic L0 route interpreter + apps_lic route profile |
| apps_lic_exit_binding.py | agentic_core/runtime/exit/ | TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER | Generic Exit enforcer + apps_lic Exit profile |
| apps_lic_promo_binding.py | agentic_core/L6_observability/promotion/ | TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER | Generic L6 consumer + apps_lic meta-feedback profile |
| apps_rg_l0_binding.py | agentic_core/L0_routing/ | TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER | Generic L0 route interpreter + apps_rg route profile |
| apps_rg_exit_binding.py | agentic_core/runtime/exit/ | TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER | Generic Exit enforcer + apps_rg Exit profile |

### Migration Procedure

1. **Create app profile** in apps_*/config/domain_contract/
   - For route: `route_profile.yaml`
   - For Exit: `exit_profile.yaml`
   - For L6: `meta_feedback_profile.yaml`

2. **Extend generic engine** in agentic_core to consume profile
   - Update resolver to read profile ref from U0 package
   - Update interpreter to apply profile generically

3. **Replace binding call** with generic engine + profile
   - Remove hardcoded binding
   - Add runtime profile resolution

4. **Verify behavior unchanged**
   - Run app tests before/after
   - Compare outputs
   - Document any intentional changes

5. **Write migration receipt**
   ```json
   {
     "receipt_version": "1.0",
     "created_at": "2026-05-11T12:00:00Z",
     "original_file": "agentic_core/L0_routing/apps_lic_l0_binding.py",
     "new_profile": "apps_lic/config/domain_contract/route_profile.yaml",
     "generic_engine": "agentic_core/L0_routing/generic_route_interpreter.py",
     "classification": "GENERIC_READY",
     "tests": ["pytest tests/apps_lic/test_l0_routing.py"],
     "verification": "identical_outputs"
   }
   ```

## Section 19: Important Constraints Summary

- **W0-W4 governance infrastructure has been implemented and certified**
- **W5 migration work is now active but tightly scoped**
- **Do not broaden W5B P1 beyond apps_lic L6/Exit/L0**
- **Do not proceed to P1c until P1a/P1b gates pass**
- **Do not weaken tests or governance hooks to make migration pass**
- **Preserve behavior parity** — all refactored bindings must pass existing tests
- **Receipt discipline** — every governance change gets a receipt
- **Plan must not merely document policy** — Must produce enforcement (rules, hooks, scripts, tests, receipts)
- **Plan must keep agentic_core generic and apps_* declarative** — Core engines + app profiles
- **Plan must explicitly say app-specific behavior in shared agentic_core is leakage unless documented as temporary thin adapter** — Receipt requirement

---

## Section 20: Output Summary

### Plan Path
`.cursor/plans/agentic-core-static-apps-customization-governance-a1b2c3.md`

### Current Wave Status

| Wave | Status | Key Deliverables | Certification |
|------|--------|------------------|---------------|
| W0 | COMPLETE | Baseline audit complete | CERTIFIED |
| W1 | COMPLETE | 7 governance docs (AGENTS.md + rules) | CERTIFIED |
| W2 | COMPLETE | 5 skills + 4 workflows | CERTIFIED |
| W3 | COMPLETE | 6 governance scripts + hooks.json | CERTIFIED |
| W4 | CERTIFIED | 6 CI tests + 17 negative controls | CERTIFIED |
| W5A | COMPLETE | Migration inventory (37 bindings, 28 scoped, 9 excluded) | ACCEPTED |
| W5B P1 | IN PROGRESS / BLOCKED | apps_lic L6/Exit/L0 migration | P1a PENDING_PROOF, P1b TEMPORARY, P1c BLOCKED |
| W5C | DEFERRED | apps_rg migration | Deferred post-W5B P1 |
| W5D | DEFERRED | apps_research consolidation | Deferred post-W5B P1 |
| W6 | TODO | Post-migration negative controls | TODO after W5B P1 |
| W7 | TODO | Final governance receipt | TODO |

### Key Blocking Rule

**The "No App-Specific Code in Core" rule is the primary blocker.** Any existing or proposed change to agentic_core that hardcodes app behavior (app_id branches, app-specific literals, app-specific policy) is blocked and must be refactored to:
1. Generic core engine + app-owned profile, or
2. Temporary thin adapter with migration receipt

### Known Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Hooks too aggressive, slow development | Bypass env var + model_decision trigger option |
| Existing code fails new CI tests | Migration receipts allow temporary exceptions |
| Generic engines slower than hardcoded | Performance testing deferred; correctness first |
| App developers bypass U0 path | app_runtime_package_scan.py enforcement |
| Receipt discipline becomes bureaucratic | Automate receipt generation, minimal fields |

### Next Recommended Action

**Do not proceed to implementation until plan is reviewed.**

After review:
1. Run W0 baseline audit to confirm inventory
2. Seek approval for W1-W4 governance infrastructure (planning-only work)
3. Schedule W5 binding migration in dedicated follow-up plans per binding
4. Author-Gate approval required before any hook activation

---

**PLAN COMPLETE: Awaiting review before implementation.**
