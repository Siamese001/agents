# Test Structure Mirror Contract - Phase 0 Discovery Report

## Wave Structure

| Waves | Metric | Scope | Checkpoint | Tokens |
|-------|--------|-------|------------|---------|
| Wave 1 | Analysis & Discovery | Review current state | A | 25,000 🟢 |
| Wave 2 | Implementation | Core changes | B | 50,000 🟢 |
| Wave 3 | Testing & Validation | Verify changes | C | 30,000 🟢 |
| Wave 4 | Documentation & Cleanup | Finalize | D | 15,000 🟢 |

**Total: 120,000 tokens across 4 waves, all GREEN**

## Executive Summary

- **Total modules**: 1,089
- **Status breakdown**:
  - MISSING: 658
  - MISLOCATED: 431
  - PRESENT: 0

## Module Distribution

- agentic_core: 601 modules
- apps_lic: 105 modules
- apps_rg: 84 modules
- apps_shared: 299 modules
- Existing tests: 431

## Key Findings

### 1. Massive Test Gap (658 MISSING)

- 60% of modules have no test coverage at all
- Most critical gaps in agentic_core (601 modules, nearly all missing tests)

### 2. Structural Misalignment (431 MISLOCATED)

- All existing tests use old structure: `tests/unit/<package>/...`
- Expected new structure: `tests/<package>/...` (direct mirroring)
- No tests currently follow the mirror contract

### 3. Zero Present Tests

- Not a single test follows the canonical mirror structure
- Complete structural remediation required

## Critical Areas Needing Immediate Attention

### agentic_core (601 modules, ~95% missing tests)

- Core infrastructure completely untested under mirror contract
- Base agents, mixins, interfaces all missing
- Runtime, config, and enforcement layers need coverage

### apps_shared (299 modules, ~85% mislocated)

- Has tests but in wrong structure (`unit/common_utils` vs direct `utils`)
- Validation, utils, types all mislocated

### apps_lic & apps_rg

- Similar patterns of missing/mislocated tests
- Engine and reasoning components need coverage

## Next Steps for Phase 1

1. **Create mirror contract test** to enforce structure
2. **Define waivers** for complex cases (e.g., pure `__init__.py` files)
3. **Move mislocated tests** to canonical locations
4. **Create missing tests** prioritized by criticality

## Sample Critical Missing Tests

```text
agentic_core/base_agents/L0MaintenanceBase.py -> tests/agentic_core/base_agents/test_L0MaintenanceBase.py
agentic_core/core/classification_kernel.py -> tests/agentic_core/core/test_classification_kernel.py
agentic_core/L5_safety/enforcement/AdapterBase.py -> tests/agentic_core/L5_safety/enforcement/test_AdapterBase.py
apps_lic/engines/HOPPipelineExecutor.py -> tests/apps_lic/engines/test_HOPPipelineExecutor.py
apps_rg/engines/RGValidationExecutor.py -> tests/apps_rg/engines/test_RGValidationExecutor.py
```

This analysis reveals a complete structural misalignment requiring systematic remediation.

## Rules

1. Follow all constitutional rules and guidelines
2. Maintain compliance with established standards
3. Document all changes and decisions
4. Validate all implementations before completion

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All objectives completed successfully
- [ ] Validation tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Stakeholder approval received
