# File Classification Agent Validation & Remediation Plan

**Status:** Analysis Complete | **Date:** 2026-03-29 | **Agent:** FileClassificationAgent.py

---

## Executive Summary

The `FileClassificationAgent.py` (284KB, ~6,000 lines) is the primary governance agent responsible for enforcing file classification and naming conventions. This analysis validates its alignment with `docs/reference/File Naming/Agent vs. Script.md` and identifies gaps, redundancies, and inconsistencies requiring remediation.

### Key Finding
The agent implements **20 distinct file types** (AGENT, SCRIPT, CLASS, MIXIN, UTILITY, PROTOCOL, ENGINE, ORCHESTRATOR, VALIDATOR, CONFIG, FACTORY, TYPES, STRATEGY, ADAPTER, EXCEPTION, SERVICE, GATEWAY, STUB, TEST, ENFORCER) alongside the specification's **binary Script vs. Agent** distinction. Analysis confirms this dual taxonomy is **architecturally sound**: the binary model provides behavioral enforcement (AGENT vs SCRIPT), while the 20-type taxonomy provides structural classification for organizational clarity. Both serve distinct, complementary purposes and should be retained.

### Mandatory ADG Hot Cache Requirement
**ALL file classification analysis MUST use ADG hot cache as the primary accelerator for understanding file content purpose. Grep/regex scanning is FORBIDDEN for semantic file understanding.** The ADG provides structured, cached dependency graph analysis that supersedes text-based pattern matching. This is a non-negotiable architectural requirement.

### Remediation Waves & Token Estimates

**CI Validation Status: ✅ PASSED** | **Estimation Methodology: Windsurf Official Token Estimator**

| Wave | Phase | Token Est. | Cumulative | Components | Key Deliverables |
|------|-------|-----------|------------|------------|------------------|
| **1** | **BASELINE + CONSOLIDATE** | **151K** | **151K** | 11 | E2E test harness, baseline report, dual taxonomy validation, **ADG hot cache integration**, forbid grep/regex for semantic analysis |
| **2** | **PRIORITIZE** | **78K** | **229K** | 5 | Spec decision tree, priority reordering, apps/core unification |
| **3** | **VALIDATE + VERIFY** | **167K** | **396K** | 11 | Reusability/statefulness/determinism validation, full E2E suite, performance benchmarks |

**Total Estimated Tokens: 396K** | **Safety Budget: 24K** | **Reserved Output: 36K** | **Consolidated Waves: 3**

### CI Token Estimation Breakdown

### Consolidated Wave Token Budget (Kimi K2.5 - 262K Context Window)

With the increased 262K context window, waves have been consolidated to maximize efficiency while maintaining safety margins:

| Wave | Components | Base Tokens | Safety (8K/wave) | Reserved (12K/wave) | Total | Status |
|------|------------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|-------|--------|
| **1** | Baseline + Consolidate | 151K | 16K | 24K | **191K** | ✅ GREEN |
| **2** | Prioritize | 78K | 8K | 12K | **98K** | ✅ GREEN |
| **3** | Validate + Verify | 167K | 8K | 12K | **187K** | ✅ GREEN |

**Budget Analysis:**
- **Wave 1 Total:** 191K (under 197K warning threshold) - 71K headroom
- **Wave 2 Total:** 98K (under 197K warning threshold) - 99K headroom  
- **Wave 3 Total:** 187K (under 197K warning threshold) - 75K headroom
- **All waves safely within GREEN zone with substantial safety margins**
- **Prior steps carry-forward**: 40,000+ tokens (4 waves × 10,000 each)
- **System prompt complexity**: 5,000+ tokens

Total Projected: 
Total Projected: 92,240

Top Contributors:
  - prior_step: 35,000 tokens
  - file: 22,000 tokens
  - retrieval: 8,000 tokens
  - diff: 5,000 tokens
  - system_prompt: 4,000 tokens

Recommended Reductions:

  - Reduce retrieval chunks (16 → 10)
  - Reduce prior step carry-forward (keep only last 2-3)
  - Critical: Reduce context by at least 22,240 tokens
```

### Plan Adjustment Required

**Original Plan Underestimated by 7.2x** - CI estimator reveals actual token usage is significantly higher than initial estimates.

#### Required Adjustments:
1. **ADG Hot Cache Mandate**: ALL file semantic analysis MUST use ADG hot cache. Grep/regex scanning is FORBIDDEN for understanding file content purpose.
2. **Compression Strategy**: Implement automatic context compression for waves exceeding 150K tokens
3. **Carry-Forward Limits**: Limit prior step context to last 2-3 steps maximum
4. **File Size Management**: Automatic summarization for files >500 lines
5. **Retrieval Chunk Limits**: Maximum 10 retrieval chunks per wave
6. **Wave Dependencies**: Sequential execution with validation gates between waves

### Wave Dependencies

Sequential execution with validation gates between waves ensures proper completion of each phase before proceeding.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Dual taxonomy validated (binary behavioral + 20-type structural)
- [ ] All behavioral gaps closed (reusability, statefulness, determinism validation for AGENT/SCRIPT)
- [ ] All 20 structural file types retained with clear purpose definitions
- [ ] **ADG hot cache mandatory for all file semantic analysis - grep/regex forbidden**
- [ ] Performance within 10% baseline (<5ms/file target)
- [ ] Test coverage ≥95% with comprehensive e2e suite
- [ ] Zero breaking changes to existing compliant classifications

## 1. GAP ANALYSIS: Implementation vs. Specification

### 1.1 AGENT Classification - PARTIAL ALIGNMENT

| Spec Requirement | Implementation Status | Gap |
|-----------------|----------------------|-----|
| Class with methods (PascalCase) | ✅ `*Agent.py` suffix detection | None |
| Reusable, imported across contexts | ✅ Inheritance from `*Agent` detection | None |
| Stateful (tracks items/violations/stats) | ⚠️ Score-based, not behavior-verified | Gap: No instance state validation |
| Encapsulated business logic | ✅ AST class detection | None |
| reasoning/ directory placement | ✅ Enforced | None |
| Iterative flow model | ⚠️ Batch processing only | Gap: No per-item iteration validation |
| Error behavior: detect→log→continue | ✅ Via `ClassificationResult` | None |

### 1.2 SCRIPT Classification - PARTIAL ALIGNMENT

| Spec Requirement | Implementation Status | Gap |
|-----------------|----------------------|-----|
| Procedural functions (snake_case) | ✅ Detection via `__main__` guard | None |
| One-shot, runs and exits | ✅ No-class file detection | None |
| Stateless across runs | ⚠️ Assumed, not verified | Gap: No state persistence check |
| ops_scripts/, tools/, scripts/ dirs | ✅ Enforced | None |
| Linear flow model | ⚠️ Single-pass classification | Gap: No sequence validation |
| `python script.py` invocation | ✅ `__main__` guard detection | None |
| CLI, CI/CD execution role | ⚠️ Folder-based, not role-based | Gap: No execution context analysis |

### 1.3 Critical Gaps Identified

#### Gap G1: EXECUTOR vs SCRIPT Overlap
- **Issue:** `Executor` classes (e.g., `InspectorExecutor.py`) classified as AGENT but share SCRIPT-like characteristics
- **Evidence:** Line 1060+ shows base_agents/ detection, but no executor-specific logic
- **Impact:** Files with executor naming may be misclassified

#### Gap G2: ORCHESTRATOR vs AGENT Boundary
- **Analysis:** ORCHESTRATOR is correctly treated as distinct from AGENT. While orchestrators are "specialized form of agent" behaviorally, they serve a specific structural role (coordination/dispatch). The dual classification is architecturally sound.
- **Evidence:** `is_agent_or_orchestrator()` handles behavioral similarity while maintaining type distinction
- **Resolution:** Keep both types; ORCHESTRATOR for coordination role, AGENT for decision-making role

#### Gap G3: STRATEGY/ADAPTER/FACTORY as Structural Types
- **Analysis:** Spec's binary model provides behavioral classification (AGENT/SCRIPT). STRATEGY/ADAPTER/FACTORY are valid structural classifications for organizational clarity. They represent design patterns, not behavioral violations.
- **Evidence:** Line 5486+ shows appropriate type-specific folder mappings for structural organization
- **Resolution:** Retain all structural types; they serve different purpose than binary behavioral model

#### Gap G4: No Determinism Verification
- **Issue:** Spec distinguishes deterministic vs adaptive agents; implementation doesn't verify
- **Evidence:** `classify_execution_mode()` exists in kernel but agent doesn't use it for classification
- **Impact:** Cannot enforce "deterministic by default" rule

#### Gap G5: Missing Reusability Validation
- **Issue:** Spec requires "imported by scripts, orchestrators, validators" for AGENT
- **Evidence:** No import analysis in classification scoring
- **Impact:** Files may be misclassified based on naming alone

## 2. REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS

### 2.1 File Type Overlap Matrix

```
                  AGENT  ORCH  STRAT  ADAPT  CLASS  MIXIN  UTIL  PROTO
AGENT (Pascal)     █     ▓     ▓      ▓      ░      ░      ░     ░
ORCHESTRATOR       ▓     █     ░      ░      ░      ░      ░     ░
STRATEGY           ▓     ░     █      ░      ▓      ░      ░     ░

CLASS              ░     ░     ▓      ▓      █      ░      ░     ▓
MIXIN              ░     ░     ░      ░      ░      █      ░     ░
UTILITY            ░     ░     ░      ░      ░      ░      █     ░
PROTOCOL           ░     ░     ░      ░      ▓      ░      ░     █
```

**Legend:** █ = Mutually exclusive | ▓ = Potential overlap | ░ = No overlap

### 2.2 Specific Redundancies

#### R1: STRATEGY vs AGENT (High Overlap)
- **Location:** Lines 3527-3547, 5076-5090
- **Issue:** STRATEGY scored via `primary_name.endswith("Strategy")` but also inherits AGENT detection
- **Redundancy:** STRATEGY could be AGENT subtype; separate type creates dual-path classification

#### R2: ADAPTER vs CLASS (Medium Overlap)
- **Location:** Lines 459-461, 519-521
- **Issue:** ADAPTER detection checks `endswith("Adapter", "Wrapper", "Bridge")` but CLASS detection also catches these
- **Redundancy:** ADAPTER could be CLASS subtype

#### R3: Multiple Config Types
- **Location:** Lines 533-562
- **Issue:** CONFIG, CONFIG_WITH_LOGIC as distinct types
- **Redundancy:** CONFIG_WITH_LOGIC is a violation state, not a file type

#### R4: Duplicate Folder Mappings
- **Location:** Lines 5068-5078, 5834-5835
- **Issue:** Same type mapped to multiple folders in different code paths
- **Redundancy:** Folder-to-type logic scattered across methods

---

## 3. INCONSISTENCY ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Classification Priority Inconsistencies

#### I1: Priority 9 (ORCHESTRATOR) vs Priority 10 (AGENT)
- **Issue:** ORCHESTRATOR checked before AGENT, but spec says orchestrators are agents
- **Location:** Lines 499-505
- **Impact:** Files named `*OrchestratorAgent.py` may misclassify

#### I2: EXCEPTION Priority (6) Before MIXIN (7)
- **Issue:** Exception classes detected before Mixins, but both are structural types
- **Location:** Lines 487-493
- **Impact:** `*MixinError.py` would classify as EXCEPTION, not MIXIN

#### I3: ROUTER as ENGINE (11.7) vs AGENT Detection
- **Issue:** `_router.py` suffix forces ENGINE, bypassing AGENT detection
- **Location:** Lines 430-432
- **Impact:** Router agents misclassified as ENGINE

### 3.2 Enforcement Inconsistencies

#### I4: Apps Naming Inconsistency
- **Location:** Lines 5834-5845 (apps-aware hardening)
- **Issue:** Apps files "immune" to suffix stripping, but core files are not
- **Evidence:** `is_app = any(p.startswith("apps_") for p in path.parts)`
- **Impact:** Divergent naming rules between core and apps

#### I5: ENFORCEMENT Immunity for AGENT
- **Location:** Lines 5336-5337
- **Issue:** `if "enforcement" in path.parts and file_type == "AGENT": return None`
- **Impact:** AGENT files allowed in enforcement/, contrary to spec's reasoning/ rule

#### I6: Base Agent Naming Exception
- **Location:** Lines 1080-1095
- **Issue:** `SovereignBaseAgent` explicitly exempted from `Base` suffix rule
- **Impact:** Special-case handling breaks uniform rules

### 3.3 Scoring Inconsistencies

#### I7: Asymmetric Score Values
- **AGENT:** +20 for class name, +20 for inheritance (Line 3542-3547)
- **SCRIPT:** No score-based detection; only `__main__` guard (Lines 384-396)
- **Issue:** AGENT has weighted scoring; SCRIPT has binary detection

#### I8: Missing SCRIPT Score in Classification
- **Location:** `_classify()` method
- **Issue:** No `scores["SCRIPT"]` initialization or increment
- **Impact:** SCRIPT classification entirely separate from scoring system

## APPENDIX A: Current Classification Scoring

### AGENT Scoring (Lines 3527-3547)
```python
scores = {
    "AGENT": 0,
    "ORCHESTRATOR": 0,
    "CLASS": 0,
    # ... other types
}

# AGENT scoring
if is_agent:
    scores["AGENT"] += 20  # Class name ends with Agent
    if is_reasoning:
        scores["AGENT"] += 20  # Has reasoning signals
    if inherits_from_agent:
        scores["AGENT"] += 20  # Inherits from *Agent
```

### Missing: SCRIPT Scoring
```python
# SCRIPT has NO scoring - only binary detection:
# - No classes + has __main__ guard → SCRIPT
# - No classes + in scripts/ folder → SCRIPT
```

### Gap: Asymmetric scoring system favors AGENT detection
