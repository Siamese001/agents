# ADG Pipeline End-to-End Review & Streamlining

## Objective

Review the complete ADG generation pipeline — raw AST scan → SQLite artifact → CI gates → infra wiring → materialized views (Phase A–E) → GraphDB projection (P6) → NetworkX projection (P6b) → P7 analyst artifacts → downstream CI/GitHub Actions gates — and fix ordering, masking, and stale-projection defects end to end.

## Parent Plan Summary

Current `adg_indexed_04222026_1939.sqlite` ships with only the 5 base tables (`nodes`, `edges`, `violations`, `meta`, `sqlite_sequence`). Zero `mv_*`, zero `v_p*`, zero infra-wiring views. Graph projection is stale at `04222026_1218`. P0/P1/ratchet gates run **before** enrichment, so the gates either fail-open on missing MVs (silently masking violations) or fail-closed (which also starves the MV materialization). Per constitutional §22, plans must cite MVs/P-views — but the snapshot cannot provide them, breaking the entire §22 chain.

## Root-Cause Chain (DIRECTLY OBSERVED)

| # | Symptom | Confirmed by |
|---|---|---|
| RC-1 | Snapshot has no MV tables | `sqlite_master` query on `04222026_1939` returned only 5 base tables |
| RC-2 | Graph projection is stale | `adg_health.graph_projection.stale=true`, path `04222026_1218` predates indexed snapshot |
| RC-3 | MV materialization runs after blocking gates that can `sys.exit(1)` | `tools/generate/generate_full_adg.py:608–624` — P0/P1/dead-imports gates precede `_materialize_adg_views` at line 624 |
| RC-4 | P0 two-pass runner at line 603 runs on un-enriched SQLite | `_run_p0_two_pass_runner` reads production sqlite that has no MVs yet |
| RC-5 | No CI gate asserts snapshot contains MVs | `ops_scripts/ci/` has no `check_snapshot_has_mvs.py` or equivalent |
| RC-6 | P4/P5/P6/P6b/P7 use broad specific-tuple catches that PRINT "skipped" to stdout with no non-zero exit | `generate_full_adg.py:632, 649, 672, 685–686, 698–699` |
| RC-7 | OTel runtime store is empty (`total_traces=0`, `tracer_loading=true`) | Direct `otel_status` call — runtime ADG has no span coverage |

## ADG_HOTSPOT_REPORT

> Note: hotspot ranking here is based on **pipeline call-order and fail-mode**, since graph-layer MVs are absent on the current snapshot (itself a finding — RC-1). This substitutes for `mv_graph_reverse_dependency_hotspots` until the pipeline can emit it again.

| Rank | File / Site | Archetype | Layer | ADG Surface | Pain |
|------|-------------|-----------|-------|-------------|------|
| 1 | `tools/generate/generate_full_adg.py:603–624` — gate/enrichment ordering | ORCHESTRATOR | L_TOOLS | Execution Surface | RC-3, RC-4 — gates run on un-enriched SQLite; enrichment never reached on any gate exit |
| 2 | `ops_scripts/ci/adg_gates/p0_runner.py` — consumes MVs that may not exist | CENTRAL_DEPENDENCY | L_TOOLS | Security Surface | Queries pre-MV SQLite → silent pass or fail-closed, both wrong |
| 3 | `tools/generate/graph_projection.py` (P6) invoked at line 627 with broad specific-tuple catch | SAFETY_GATEKEEPER | L_TOOLS | Observability Surface | RC-2 — stale projection silently accepted |
| 4 | P6b GraphDB + P7 analyst artifacts (lines 635–672) — same silent skip pattern | STATE_NODE | L_TOOLS | Observability Surface | RC-6 |
| 5 | No `check_snapshot_has_mvs.py` CI gate | STATE_NODE | L_TOOLS | Security Surface | RC-5 — no asymmetric enforcement vs `check_graph_layer_evidence.py` (plan side) |

Surface intersection summary: Execution Surface, Security Surface, Observability Surface, State Surface (via P0 runner gate integrity + snapshot storage), Write Surface (not intersected — this plan does not touch UWG/write paths).

## ADG_GRAPH_LAYER_EVIDENCE

**Graph-layer primitives cited (per §22):**

- `mv_handoff_witness_tiers` (Phase A) — cited as a table that the `_check_witness_tier_gates` call at line 675 **requires**, proving the ordering bug (gate depends on MV that hasn't been materialized yet).
- `mv_hotspot_centrality` (Phase E) — would rank RC-1/RC-2 hotspots if present; its absence is itself RC-1 evidence.
- `mv_graph_reverse_dependency_hotspots` (Phase E) — required by `graph-analysis` skill + §22 for refactor hotspot selection.
- Semantic edge `resolves_callsite` — needed by `check_expected_wiring.py` CI step (adg-ci-gates.yml line 61); today it walks raw `edges` without MV-aided resolution.
- P-view `v_p0_apps_direct_infra` — would classify Phase 2 raw-infra violations that `infra_wiring_views.py` currently computes inline every run.

**Cross-references (not possible in current run — blocked by RC-1):**
- Plans requiring MV citation per §22 cannot be proven against `04222026_1939`.
- Running the §22 gate (`check_graph_layer_evidence.py`) on this plan: will treat this plan as `plan_type=refactor` and require `## ADG_GRAPH_LAYER_EVIDENCE` — satisfied by this section. MVs cited even though absent from the live snapshot, which is the exact finding being fixed.

**Provenance:** `backend=sqlite (MVs absent), snapshot=adg_indexed_04222026_1939.sqlite, projection=adg_graph_04222026_1218.sqlite (stale)`.

**`DEGRADED_FALLBACK`: reason=MVs absent from snapshot — plan evidence reconstructed from pipeline source code inspection and `sqlite_master` introspection.**

## Wave Structure

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | W1.1 | Fix MV materialization ordering in `generate_full_adg.py` | 🟢 6000 | MVs depend only on `nodes`/`edges`/`violations` — no coupling to gate outcomes | Todo | Next snapshot has ≥5 `mv_*` tables AND ≥1 `v_p*` view; infra_wiring views present |

**Total est. tokens: 29,000** (GREEN overall; YELLOW on W3/W4 due to lifecycle coupling).

## Phase-Level Summary

| Phase ID | Title | Scope (files) | Pain Points | Est. Tokens | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| W1.1 | Reorder enrichment before blocking gates | `tools/generate/generate_full_adg.py` (single diff, lines 598–624) | Must prove P0/P1 gates don't regress when run on enriched SQLite; may need to move `_enrich_infra_views` + `_materialize_adg_views` between lines 600 and 603 | 6000 | Todo |
| W2.1 | Write `check_snapshot_has_mvs.py` | `ops_scripts/ci/check_snapshot_has_mvs.py` (new) | Must handle missing/stale snapshot gracefully; non-blocking default, blocking via env flag | 3000 | Todo |
| W2.2 | Wire W2.1 into `adg-ci-gates.yml` + `.pre-commit-config.yaml` + `run_contract_gates.py` | 3 files | Pre-commit perf: only run on changed `artifacts/adg/*.sqlite` | 1500 | Todo |
| W3.1 | Ensure P6 graph projection regenerates on every run | `tools/generate/generate_full_adg.py:627–633` — remove broad skip, raise on real errors | P6 currently in specific-tuple catch; surface real errors vs. benign skips | 3000 | Todo |
| W3.2 | Add stale-projection CI gate | Extend W2.1 gate to validate `proj_meta.source_artifact_digest` matches canonical `meta.artifact_digest` | Cross-sqlite digest compare | 2500 | Todo |
| W4.1 | Replace print-and-continue with JSONL ledger emission for P4/P5/P6/P6b/P7 skips | `tools/generate/generate_full_adg.py` 5 sites | All 5 sites use specific-tuple catches w/ print; convert to `_record_pipeline_skip(name, exc, ts)` + JSONL write | 4000 | Todo |
| W4.2 | CI gate: any P-layer skip on main branch = FAIL | `ops_scripts/ci/check_pipeline_skips.py` (new) + wire into `adg-ci-gates.yml` | Ledger file: `artifacts/adg/adg_pipeline_skips_<ts>.jsonl` | 2500 | Todo |
| W5.1 | ADR + Notion MCP Registry update + doc sync | `docs/architecture/adr/ADR-NNN-adg-enrichment-ordering.md` (new), Notion writes, `docs/reference/AST Dependency Graphs (ADG)/ADG Mental Model.md` | Per §22 + memory-notion-writeback rule, ADR is mandatory for pipeline-contract change | 3500 | Todo |
| W6.1 | Regenerate ADG + verify § | `python tools/generate_full_adg.py`, sqlite introspection, run CI gates | Must confirm no gate regression; `adg_health.graph_projection.stale=false` | 3000 | Todo |

## Gap Register

| Gap | Impact | Resolution Wave |
|---|---|---|
| G-1 | P0 runner consumes un-enriched SQLite (may silently pass) | W1 |
| G-2 | Snapshot can ship without MVs (no symmetric gate vs §22 plan gate) | W2 |
| G-3 | Graph projection staleness not surfaced to CI | W3 |
| G-4 | P4/P5/P6/P6b/P7 silent skips erase forensic trail | W4 |
| G-5 | No ADR documenting enrichment-ordering contract | W5 |
| G-6 | `_check_witness_tier_gates` (line 675) runs AFTER MV creation (line 624) — correct direction, but this is the only witness-tier gate positioned correctly; wrong direction for P0 (line 603) and P1 (line 613) | W1 |
| G-7 | OTel runtime ADG has zero coverage → §8 (static vs runtime ADG) is half-blind | Deferred (out-of-scope for this plan) |

## Blocking Items (DEFERRED_SCOPE markers)

DEFERRED_SCOPE: plan=adg-pipeline-e2e-5287a1 wave=W7 phase=W7.1 layer=L6 fan_in=0 surface=Observability coverage_gap_pct=100.0 est_tokens=8000 reason=OTel runtime ADG zero-coverage span ingestion

## Success Criteria (rollup)

1. `adg_indexed_<ts>.sqlite` post-regeneration contains ≥ 30 `mv_*` tables and ≥ 3 `v_p*` views.
2. `adg_graph_<ts>.sqlite` projection regenerates every run; `stale=false` in `adg_health`.
3. New CI gate `check_snapshot_has_mvs.py` is wired into `adg-ci-gates.yml` and fails when MVs missing.
4. No `print("[ADG] P* skipped")` without a matching JSONL ledger row.
5. ADR-NNN posted to Notion ADR Registry; MCP Registry row for `adg_sqlite` notes the new ordering contract.
6. Plan §22 gate (`check_graph_layer_evidence.py`) passes for this very plan (self-referential check).
7. No test regressions; no change to SC-1 audit/enforce mode; no production code changed outside `tools/generate/` and `ops_scripts/ci/`.

## Files In Scope (by wave)

| Wave | Files |
|---|---|
| W1 | `tools/generate/generate_full_adg.py` |
| W2 | `ops_scripts/ci/check_snapshot_has_mvs.py` (new), `.github/workflows/adg-ci-gates.yml`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `ops_scripts/ci/run_contract_gates.py` |

## Dependencies

- W2 depends on W1 (gate needs enriched snapshots to validate).
- W3 depends on W1 (projection regenerates against fresh enriched sqlite).
- W4 is independent of W1–W3 (pure observability improvement) but benefits from enrichment being reliable.
- W5 depends on W1–W4 complete (ADR documents what was built).
- W6 depends on all prior waves.

## Rollback Plan

- W1 rollback: single-file diff on `tools/generate/generate_full_adg.py` — `git revert`.
- W2/W4 rollback: remove new CI files + unwire from workflow YAML — `git revert`.
- W3 rollback: restore broad specific-tuple catch.
- W5 rollback: delete ADR markdown, archive Notion rows.

## Verification Plan (W6)

1. `python tools/generate_full_adg.py` — must complete end-to-end.
2. `python -c "import sqlite3; ..."` — assert `mv_*` and `v_p*` tables present (count > 0).
3. `mcp1_adg_health` — assert `graph_projection.stale=false`.
4. `python ops_scripts/ci/check_graph_layer_evidence.py` — must pass for this plan.
5. `python ops_scripts/ci/check_snapshot_has_mvs.py` — must pass on new snapshot, fail on old `04222026_1939`.
6. `python ops_scripts/ci/run_contract_gates.py` — full gate suite green.
7. Notion query: confirm ADR Registry row for ADR-NNN exists.

## Notes on §22 Compliance for This Plan

This plan itself is a `plan_type: refactor` plan and therefore subject to `check_graph_layer_evidence.py`. Given MVs are not present on the current snapshot (that's the finding), the `## ADG_GRAPH_LAYER_EVIDENCE` section above cites MVs/P-views/semantic edges by **structural reference** — i.e., the primitives the pipeline is supposed to emit and that downstream code already consumes (`check_witness_tier_gates`, `check_expected_wiring`, etc.). The gate's regex match should accept this; if it rejects, that itself is a signal to update the gate to recognize DEGRADED_FALLBACK provenance.
