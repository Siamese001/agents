## Gap Register

### GAP-1: UWG Ingress Gate Coverage (HIGH PRIORITY)
The L4 & UWG State reference document specifies 7 sequential stages in the UWG/L4 pipeline. Stage 2 (UWG Ingress Gate) and Stage 3 (Validation Gate) require ADG coverage for:

- **verify_signature** — No ADG relation type or frozenset exists
- **verify_active_policy_hash** — POLICY_HASH_SYMBOLS exists but no UWG-specific validation
- **check_allowed_capability_set** — No capability set validation frozenset at UWG boundary
- **scope/RBAC/blast_radius** — MUTATION_TRANSPORT_CLASSES has BlastRadiusChecker but no UWG integration

**Impact**: UWG ingress operations are invisible to ADG governance queries. Cannot trace mutations back to policy validation.

### GAP-2: Mutation Record Assembly Coverage (HIGH PRIORITY)
Stage 4 (Mutation Record Assembly) requires 4 operations with no current ADG coverage:

- **Generate Before/After Diff** — RFC6902_DIFF_SYMBOLS exists but no `generates_diff` relation type
- **Compute Replay Key** — REPLAY_KEY_METHODS exists but no mutation-specific replay key frozenset
- **Apply HMAC Seal** — No HMAC seal frozenset or relation type
- **Package ExecutionTrace Artifact** — EXECUTION_TRACE_CLASSES exists but no packaging frozenset

**Impact**: Mutation provenance incomplete. Cannot verify mutation integrity via ADG queries.

### GAP-3: Authoritative Commit Coverage (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Stage 5 (Authoritative Commit) operations lack ADG coverage:

- **Claim sole write lock** — No `claims_write_lock` relation type or frozenset
- **Execute durable commit** — `commits_mutation` relation exists but no durable commit frozenset
- **Hash chain append** — `mutation_signature`, `parent_snapshot_hash` relation types exist but no hash chain frozenset
- **Rollback/heal on fail** — HEALING_ORCHESTRATOR_CLASSES exists but no rollback-specific coverage

**Impact**: Commit durability and rollback operations invisible to ADG. Cannot trace L4 master ledger state changes.

### GAP-4: L4 Read Surface Materialization (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Stage 6 operations lack ADG coverage:

- **Generate Materialized Read Views** — No `materializes_read_view` relation type
- **Retrieval surface refresh** — RETRIEVAL_SYMBOLS exists but no refresh frozenset
- **Versioned alias swap** — No `swaps_version_alias` relation type or frozenset
- **Telemetry/audit sync** — P4 observability emitters exist but no L4-specific sync frozenset

**Impact**: L4 read surface operations invisible. Cannot trace how mutations propagate to read views.

### GAP-5: Outbound Read Bridges (LOW PRIORITY)
Stage 7 (Outbound Read Bridges) lacks ADG coverage for:

- **C0/L1 context builds** — JIT_CONTEXT_CLASSES exists but no `reads_l4_surface` frozenset
- **L0 policy_hash receipt** — POLICY_HASH_SYMBOLS exists but no L0 receipt frozenset
- **L5 constitution boundaries** — SAFETY_PLANE_CLASSES exists but no L5 L4-read frozenset
- **L3 DAG workflow rules** — No L3 reads L4 frozenset
- **L6 execution trace ingestion** — P4 emitters exist but no L6 L4-ingest frozenset

**Impact**: Cross-layer L4 state consumption invisible to ADG.

- [ ] `_L4OutboundBridgeVisitor` implemented
- [ ] 19/19 scanner tests pass
- [ ] All 20 new relation types have >20 edges each in ADG

---

## Rules

1. **Never widen denominator frozensets** — EXECUTION_TRACE_CLASSES and GUARDRAIL_CLASS_NAMES remain locked
2. **Always self-bootstrap** — Every new emitter function must call itself at module level for scanner visibility
3. **Follow P0-P4 naming** — Use `_emit_` prefix for all emitter functions
4. **Scanner test non-regression** — 19/19 tests must pass after each wave
5. **ADG regeneration between waves** — Run `python tools/generate_full_adg.py --force` after each wave
6. **Layer gravity compliance** — L4 scanner visitors only reference L0-L4 symbols

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 20 new relation types defined in schema.py RelationType
- [ ] All 17 new frozensets defined in schema.py with `__all__` entries
- [ ] All 17 new emitter functions in lifecycle_trace_contract.py with self-bootstrap
- [ ] 4 new scanner visitors implemented (G34-G37)
- [ ] 19/19 scanner tests pass with no regressions
- [ ] ADG shows >100 new L4/UWG-specific edges per wave
- [ ] GitHub sync completed after each wave with commit messages following pattern: `L4-UWG-W{wave}-{phase}: {description}`

---

## Implementation Commands

```bash
# Wave 1 implementation
python agentic_core/planning/token_estimator.py --file agentic_core/adg/schema.py --operation extend
python tools/generate_full_adg.py --force
python -m pytest tests/adg/test_static_scanner.py -v

# Wave 2 implementation
python tools/generate_full_adg.py --force
python -m pytest tests/adg/test_static_scanner.py -v

# Wave 3 implementation
python tools/generate_full_adg.py --force
python -m pytest tests/adg/test_static_scanner.py -v

# Wave 4 implementation
python tools/generate_full_adg.py --force
python -m pytest tests/adg/ -v

# Final verification
python tools/adg/accelerators/adg_coverage_reporter.py --comprehensive
```

---

## Rollback Strategy

If scanner tests fail or ADG shows unexpected edge count drops:

1. **Immediate**: Run `python tools/adg/repair/adg_rollback.py --to-last-known-good`
2. **Per-wave**: Revert specific wave commits using `git revert HEAD~{N}..HEAD`
3. **Diagnostic**: Check `artifacts/adg/repair_log_*.json` for failure patterns
4. **Fallback**: Use backup ADG from `artifacts/adg/_archive/` (if available)
