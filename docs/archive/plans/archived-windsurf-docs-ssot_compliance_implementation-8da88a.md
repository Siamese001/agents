# SSOT Compliance Implementation Plan

This plan implements the immediate fixes and preventive measures identified in the RCA to ensure all plans are saved to SSOT-compliant locations.

## Wave Structure

| Waves | Metric | Scope | Checkpoint | Tokens |
|-------|--------|-------|------------|---------|
| Wave 1 | Analysis & Discovery | Review current state | A | 25,000 🟢 |
| Wave 2 | Implementation | Core changes | B | 50,000 🟢 |
| Wave 3 | Testing & Validation | Verify changes | C | 30,000 🟢 |
| Wave 4 | Documentation & Cleanup | Finalize | D | 15,000 🟢 |

**Total: 120,000 tokens across 4 waves, all GREEN**

## Phase 1: Immediate Fix ()

### 1.1 Move Plan to SSOT Location
- [ ] Create `docs/reports/plans/` directory if it doesn't exist
- [ ] Move `resolution-asymmetry-remediation-8da88a.md` to `docs/reports/plans/`
- [ ] Verify the plan is accessible in the new location
- [ ] Update any references to the old location

### 1.2 Validate Compliance
- [ ] Run `python scripts/hooks/validate_report_location.py --fix`
- [ ] Confirm no violations for the moved plan
- [ ] Check that the plan matches report file patterns

## Phase 2: Process Update ()

### 2.1 Update Planning Guidance
- [ ] Create SSOT-compliant plan template in `docs/reports/plans/template.md`
- [ ] Update planning guidance to reference SSOT requirements
- [ ] Add SSOT location check to planning workflow
- [ ] Include SSOT compliance checklist in planning process

### 2.2 Documentation Updates
- [ ] Add SSOT section to planning documentation
- [ ] Create quick reference for approved report locations
- [ ] Update onboarding materials with SSOT requirements
- [ ] Document the new plan creation process

## Phase 3: Prevention (Ongoing)

### 3.1 Tooling Improvements
- [ ] Create plan creation script that auto-saves to SSOT location
- [ ] Add pre-commit hook validation for plan files
- [ ] Implement automated SSOT checks during plan creation
- [ ] Create plan migration script for existing misplaced plans

### 3.2 Monitoring & Enforcement
- [ ] Add SSOT compliance to code review checklist
- [ ] Schedule regular compliance audits
- [ ] Set up alerts for SSOT violations
- [ ] Track compliance metrics in dashboard

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create SSOT Directory Structure
```bash
mkdir -p docs/reports/plans
```

### Step 2: Move Existing Plan
```bash
mv "C:\Users\amita\.windsurf\plans\resolution-asymmetry-remediation-8da88a.md" docs/reports/plans/
```

### Step 3: Validate Location
```bash
python scripts/hooks/validate_report_location.py --staged-only
```

### Step 4: Create Plan Template
Create `docs/reports/plans/plan_template.md` with SSOT-compliant structure

### Step 5: Update Process Documentation
Update all planning guides to reference SSOT requirements

## Success Criteria

### Immediate
- [ ] Plan is in SSOT-compliant location
- [ ] No validation errors
- [ ] Plan is accessible to all team members

### Process
- [ ] All future plans saved to SSOT location
- [ ] Planning process updated
- [ ] Team trained on new process

### Long-term
- [ ] Zero SSOT violations for plans
- [ ] Automated enforcement in place
- [ ] Compliance metrics tracked

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **File Access**: Ensure proper permissions for `docs/reports/plans/`
- **Git Tracking**: Add new directory to version control
- **Build Process**: Update any build scripts expecting old location

### Process Risks
- **Team Adoption**: Communicate changes clearly
- **Backward Compatibility**: Provide migration path for existing plans
- **Documentation**: Keep all references updated

## Rollout Plan

1. **Immediate** (Now): Move existing plan
2. **Today**: Update documentation and create template
3. **This Week**: Implement tooling improvements
4. **Next Week**: Team training and full rollout

## Monitoring
- Daily compliance checks for first week
- Weekly audits thereafter
- Monthly review of process effectiveness

## Rules

1. Follow all constitutional rules and guidelines
2. Maintain compliance with established standards
3. Document all changes and decisions
4. Validate all implementations before completion
