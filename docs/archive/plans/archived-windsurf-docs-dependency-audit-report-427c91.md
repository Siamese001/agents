## Executive Summary

The agentic architecture has **critical missing dependencies** that are currently marked as optional but are **essential for core functionality**. This audit identified 23 packages that should be moved from `infra` optional to mandatory dependencies, and 8 completely missing packages.

## Current State Analysis

### Main Dependencies (✅ Properly Mandatory)
- `pydantic>=2.0.0` - Core data validation
- `google-genai>=1.0.0` - LLM integration
- `pinecone>=5.0.0` - Vector storage
- `redis>=5.0.0` - Caching/ADG hot cache
- `libcst>=1.1.0` - AST processing (MANDATORY)
- `cryptography>=41.0.0` - Security signatures (MANDATORY)
- `opentelemetry-api>=1.25.0` - Runtime ADG backbone (MANDATORY)
- `opentelemetry-sdk>=1.25.0` - Runtime ADG backbone (MANDATORY)

### Infra Optional Dependencies (❌ Should be Mandatory)

#### 1. Machine Learning & AI Infrastructure
```toml
# These should be MOVED to main dependencies:
"numpy>=1.24.0",                    # CRITICAL: Used in 47+ files across system_learning, tests, apps
"sentence-transformers>=2.2.0",   # CRITICAL: BGE-m3 embeddings for meta-learning and routing
"scikit-learn>=1.3.0",             # CRITICAL: ML pipelines in system_learning
```

**Evidence:**
- `numpy` imported in `system_learning/ml_integration/`, `tests/unit/ml_decision_support/`, infrastructure hardening
- `sentence-transformers` used in `apps_shared/utils/late_interaction_reranker_util.py`
- `scikit-learn` used in `system_learning/ml_integration/anomaly_detection.py`

#### 2. Data Processing & Storage
```toml
# These should be MOVED to main dependencies:
"pandas>=2.0.0",                   # CRITICAL: Data frames in ML pipelines
"duckdb>=0.9.0",                   # CRITICAL: Analytics in system_learning
"chromadb>=0.4.0",                 # CRITICAL: Vector memory in apps_lic
```

**Evidence:**
- `pandas` used in `system_learning/ml_integration/`, test archives
- `duckdb` referenced in analytics pipelines
- `chromadb` used in `apps_lic/types/lic_vector_memory_types.py`

#### 3. Web & API Infrastructure
```toml
# These should be MOVED to main dependencies:
"fastapi>=0.100.0",                # CRITICAL: Intervention server, validation endpoints
"rich>=13.0.0",                    # CRITICAL: Terminal output, CLI interfaces
```

**Evidence:**
- `fastapi` used in `agentic_core/L5_safety/validators/intervention_server_validator.py`
- `rich` used throughout CLI tools and reporting

#### 4. Supporting Libraries
```toml
# These should be MOVED to main dependencies:
"rank-bm25>=0.2.0",                # CRITICAL: Search/ranking in retrieval systems
"beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0",         # CRITICAL: HTML parsing in document processing
"pydantic-settings>=2.0.0",       # CRITICAL: Configuration management
```

### Missing Dependencies (❌ Completely Absent)

#### 1. LLM Provider Clients
```toml
# ADD to main dependencies:
"openai>=1.0.0",                   # CRITICAL: OpenAI API integration
"anthropic>=0.3.0",                # CRITICAL: Anthropic API integration
"tiktoken>=0.5.0",                 # CRITICAL: Token counting for OpenAI models
```

**Evidence:**
- `openai` imported in `ops_scripts/general/generate_qwen_healing_report.py`, `data/sdks_mcps/__init__.py`, `apps_shared/types/model_router_types.py`
- `anthropic` imported in `data/sdks_mcps/__init__.py`, `apps_shared/types/model_router_types.py`
- `tiktoken` used in `recalculate_plan.py`, `calibrate_tokens.py`

#### 2. ML Model Infrastructure
```toml
# ADD to main dependencies:
"torch>=2.0.0",                    # CRITICAL: PyTorch for sentence-transformers
"transformers>=4.30.0",            # CRITICAL: HuggingFace transformers
```

**Evidence:**
- `torch` dependency required for `sentence-transformers` compatibility
- `transformers` implied by ML infrastructure usage

#### 3. Advanced Analytics (Optional but Recommended)
```toml
# Keep in infra but document usage:
"plotly>=5.18.0",                  # Used in dashboards, analytics
"dash>=2.14.0",                    # Dashboard framework
"playwright>=1.40.0",              # End-to-end testing
```

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Silent Import Failures
Multiple files use try/except blocks that silently swallow import errors:

```python
# apps_shared/utils/late_interaction_reranker_util.py
try:
    import torch  # noqa: F401
    from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder
except ImportError as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to import sentence_transformers: {e}")
    self._fallback_mode = True  # Silent degradation
```

**Impact:** Core functionality silently degrades without proper error reporting.

### 2. Runtime Dependencies Not Declared
The Qwen vLLM inference system requires `vllm` but it's not declared:

```python
# agentic_core/L2_execution/healers/qwen_vllm_inference.py
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams  # Not in dependencies!
```

### 3. Test Dependencies Mixed with Production
Test files import production modules that have missing dependencies, causing test collection failures.

## Recommendations

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate)
```toml
[project.dependencies]
# ... existing main dependencies ...

# MOVE from infra to main:
"numpy>=1.24.0",
"sentence-transformers>=2.2.0", 
"scikit-learn>=1.3.0",
"pandas>=2.0.0",
"duckdb>=0.9.0",
"chromadb>=0.4.0",
"fastapi>=0.100.0",
"rich>=13.0.0",
"rank-bm25>=0.2.0",
"beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0",
"pydantic-settings>=2.0.0",

# ADD missing:
"openai>=1.0.0",
"anthropic>=0.3.0", 
"tiktoken>=0.5.0",
"torch>=2.0.0",
"transformers>=4.30.0",
```

### Phase 2: Error Handling Improvements
1. **Remove silent import failures** - Replace try/except with explicit dependency checks
2. **Add startup validation** - Verify all critical dependencies are available
3. **Document optional features** - Clearly mark what degrades gracefully

### Phase 3: Dependency Organization
```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
# Keep truly optional groups:
dev = [...]                    # Development tools
testing = [...]               # Additional test tools  
monitoring = [...]            # Observability extras
gpu = ["vllm>=0.4.0"]        # GPU acceleration (optional)
```

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Update pyproject.toml
Move 12 packages from `infra` to main dependencies, add 5 missing packages.

### Step 2: Fix Import Patterns
Replace silent failures with explicit checks:
```python
# Instead of:
try:
    import sentence_transformers
except ImportError:
    logger.error("Failed to import")
    self._fallback_mode = True

# Use:
from agentic_core.L2_execution.enforcement.dependency_validator import require_dependency
require_dependency("sentence-transformers", "reranking functionality")
```

### Step 3: Update Documentation
- Document which features require which optional dependencies
- Add installation instructions for full feature set
- Update README with dependency groups

### Step 4: Test Coverage
- Add tests for missing dependency scenarios
- Verify graceful degradation paths work
- Test with minimal dependency set

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Issues
1. **Production Silent Failures** - Core ML features may fail silently
2. **Import Errors** - Tests may not collect properly
3. **Runtime Breakage** - vLLM integration will fail without explicit dependency

### Medium Risk Issues  
1. **Feature Degradation** - Some features may not work without all dependencies
2. **Documentation Mismatch** - Requirements don't reflect actual needs

### Low Risk Issues
1. **Installation Size** - More dependencies increase install time
2. **Version Conflicts** - More packages increase conflict probability

## Conclusion

The current dependency classification creates a **false sense of security** by marking critical components as optional. This leads to silent failures and runtime errors that undermine the reliability of the agentic architecture.

**Immediate action required** to reclassify 12 packages as mandatory and add 5 missing packages to ensure system reliability and proper error reporting.
