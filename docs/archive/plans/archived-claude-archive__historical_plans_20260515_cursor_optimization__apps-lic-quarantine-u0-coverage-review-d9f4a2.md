# apps_lic Quarantine-to-U0 Packet Coverage Review

Exhaustive evidence-first review determining whether all legitimate apps_lic quarantined capabilities are incorporated into the apps_lic U0 input packet and downstream agentic_core contract chain.

---

## Context (SCQA)

- **Situation** — apps_lic rides the canonical agentic_core spine (U0→L1→L0→C0→PA→L2→Exit→UWG→L4→L6). A comprehensive `AppsLicIngressContractV1` (880-line Pydantic contract at `apps_lic/contracts/apps_lic_ingress_contract_v1.py`) defines the U0 shape. The app has ~50+ engine/reasoning/validator/service files, archived L1 cognition planners (`archives/apps_lic_L1_cognition_20260504/`), archived dead code (`archives/adg_dead_code/2026-04-23/apps_lic/`), and `apps_lic/migrations/` + `apps_lic/scripts/` containing legacy purge/migration utilities. No dedicated `_quarantine/` folder exists — quarantined state is implicit (deprecated/legacy/disabled markers in-tree).
- **Complication** — Without a dedicated quarantine folder, it is unclear whether all valid capabilities scattered across in-tree "quarantine-equivalent" locations (deprecated engines, disabled validators, migration scripts, legacy types, archived planners) have been represented in the U0 ingress contract or downstream contracts. Stranded capabilities could mean functional gaps or unsafe bypasses.
- **Question** — Are all valid apps_lic quarantined capabilities now represented in the U0 input packet and downstream agentic_core contract chain, or are there missing functions stranded in quarantine?
- **Answer** — This plan executed an 8-wave evidence-gathering audit (no code changes) producing structured JSON artifacts, a gap register, and a retirement-or-remediation decision packet. W0–W7 complete. Final audit execution status: PASS. Final coverage verdict: FAIL (7 HIGH gaps are auto-generated scaffold stubs with zero real logic — all recommended RETIRE_WITH_RECEIPT). 2 items require owner decision.

## Out Of Scope

- Unquarantining any files
- Restoring quarantined code to production paths
- Patching or fixing any discovered gaps (review only)
- Modifying `AppsLicIngressContractV1` or any downstream contracts
- Creating new tests (documenting missing tests only)
- Changes to `agentic_core/` bindings
- Other apps (`apps_rg`, `apps_qna`, etc.) — apps_lic only

## Gap Register (W4 Final — 2026-05-11)

### 7 HIGH — ACTIVE_RUNTIME_GAP — BLOCKS_FINAL_PASS

Archived ADG-dead tools with **no active replacement** for their specific capability. W3 automated matching was a false positive (generic terms only: Initialize, Process, configuration, tools).

| Gap ID | Inventory ID | Capability | Expected Home |
|--------|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| W4-GAP-021 | W1-QINV-0069 | Aggregate Campaign State | apps_lic active runtime engine |
| W4-GAP-023 | W1-QINV-0075 | Compute Personalization Match | apps_lic active runtime engine |
| W4-GAP-024 | W1-QINV-0076 | Diagnose Personalization Issues | apps_lic active runtime engine |
| W4-GAP-025 | W1-QINV-0084 | Log Campaign Metrics | apps_lic active runtime engine |
| W4-GAP-029 | W1-QINV-0090 | Search Similar Messages | apps_lic active runtime engine |
| W4-GAP-030 | W1-QINV-0091 | Snapshot Campaign State | apps_lic active runtime engine |
| W4-GAP-031 | W1-QINV-0092 | Update Recipient Profiles | apps_lic active runtime engine |

**Recommendation**: In a later remediation wave, either prove intentional retirement with an explicit retirement receipt, or map the capability into the active runtime / U0 / downstream contract chain.

### 6 LOW — DOCUMENTATION_ONLY_GAP / TEST_COVERAGE_GAP — DOES_NOT_BLOCK_W5

| Gap ID | Inventory ID | Capability | Type | Reason |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------|--------|
| W4-GAP-016 | W1-QINV-0053 | app content validator agent types | DOCUMENTATION_ONLY | Orphaned: 0 imports repo-wide (664 lines) |
| W4-GAP-017 | W1-QINV-0055 | lic vector memory types | DOCUMENTATION_ONLY | Orphaned: 0 imports repo-wide (563 lines) |
| W4-GAP-018 | W1-QINV-0058 | recipient archetype types | DOCUMENTATION_ONLY | Orphaned: 0 imports repo-wide (597 lines) |
| W4-GAP-019 | W1-QINV-0061 | state checkpoint types | DOCUMENTATION_ONLY | Orphaned: 0 imports repo-wide (444 lines) |
| W4-GAP-020 | W1-QINV-0062 | validation severity types | DOCUMENTATION_ONLY | Orphaned: 0 imports repo-wide (610 lines) |
| W4-GAP-008 | W1-QINV-0027 | migrations/__init__.py | TEST_COVERAGE | Test-only references; not contract-chain coverage |

### 2 NEEDS_REVIEW — NEEDS_OWNER_DECISION

| Gap ID | Inventory ID | Source | Reason |
|--------|-------------|--------|--------|
| W4-GAP-010 | W1-QINV-0033 | `apps_lic/migrations/w5_migration.py` | BLOCKER_REVIEW, 76 markers, write-like calls — unclear if stranded |
| W4-GAP-035 | W1-QINV-0102 | `archives/.../network_ops.py` | Unclear scope — infrastructure utility or stranded runtime? |

### 23 NOT_A_GAP (confirmed)

17 P0_CONFIRMED_COVERED (specific active replacements verified), 2 NON_RUNTIME, 4 INFO documentation-only scripts.

---

## W4 Key Findings

1. **7 archived tools are true ACTIVE_RUNTIME_GAPs** — W3 automated matching relied on generic terms; manual P0 review overrode to MISSING.
2. **5 type files are orphaned** — `grep_search` confirmed zero imports from any file across the entire repo.
3. **Both archived L1 planners confirmed relocated** — `message_planner.py` → `apps_lic/reasoning/message_planner.py` (score=67), `profile_planner.py` → `apps_lic/reasoning/profile_planner.py` (score=49).
4. **25% P0 false-positive rate** — automated term-matching over-counted coverage on archived tools.
5. **No BLOCKER-severity gaps** — 7 HIGH items block final pass but not W5.

## Execution Plan

### Wave 0 — Pre-flight Baseline ✅ DONE

**Result**: 155 py files in apps_lic, 39 archived apps_lic files, test harness confirmed, ADG health green.

### Wave 1 — Quarantine Inventory ✅ DONE

**Result**: 109 items inventoried (103 reviewable + 6 generated/cache excluded). 4 location types: IN_TREE_ACTIVE (42), IN_TREE_QUARANTINE_EQUIVALENT (25), ARCHIVED_ADG_DEAD_CODE (37), ARCHIVED_L1_COGNITION (2), plus generated/cache. Builder script: `artifacts/apps_lic/build_w1_quarantine_inventory.py`.

### Wave 2 — Capability Classification ✅ DONE

**Result**: 103 items classified into A-L spine buckets. Distribution: H_EXIT_EVAL_CONTROL (48), G_L2_EXECUTE (33), NON_RUNTIME_UTILITY (11), C_L0_ROUTE (6), B_L1_INTERPRET_PLAN (5), J_L4_DURABLE_STATE (4), L_L5_00C_GOVERNANCE_GATES (1), E_PROMPT_ASSEMBLY (1). 28 items flagged P0_MUST_MAP. Builder: `artifacts/apps_lic/build_w2_capability_classification.py`.

### Wave 3 — U0 + Downstream Cross-Check ✅ DONE

**Result**: 10,004 searchable surfaces collected. 103 items mapped: 92 COVERED (17 U0, 9 field map, 44 downstream, 22 active runtime), 5 MISSING_CANDIDATE, 1 TEST_ONLY, 4 DOCUMENTED_ONLY, 1 NOT_RUNTIME. P0 manual review found 7 false positives (archived tools matched only on generic terms). Both archived L1 planners confirmed relocated to `apps_lic/reasoning/`. Builders: `build_w3_search_surfaces.py`, `build_w3_mapping_matrix.py`.

### Wave 4 — Gap Identification ✅ DONE

**Result**: 38 candidates assessed → 13 true gaps (7 HIGH archived-tool runtime gaps, 5 LOW orphaned types, 1 LOW test-only migration init), 23 not-gap, 2 NEEDS_REVIEW. 7 BLOCKS_FINAL_PASS. No BLOCKER-severity items. W5 is not blocked. Builder: `build_w4_gap_register.py`.

### Wave 5 — Test + Proof Review ✅ DONE

**Result**: 722 apps_contract tests pass; 19 fail (pre-existing fixture deps); 31 errors (pre-existing + 3 EXPECTED_GUARD_BEHAVIOR quarantine RuntimeErrors). All 14 coverage categories have TEST_REFERENCE_ONLY status. 3 governance quarantine guards pass. **7 HIGH gaps have ZERO executable test assertions** — references exist only in `tests/architecture/mirror_discovery_snapshot.json` (data file, not test). 2 NEEDS_REVIEW items have passing tests but only prove utility mechanics, not contract-chain coverage. Builder scripts: `build_w5_test_reference_scan.py`, `build_w5_test_proof_matrix.py`.

### Wave 6 — Deliverable Emission ✅ DONE

**Result**: Final JSON receipt and markdown summary emitted. 15 prior artifacts validated (0 missing, 0 invalid). **Audit execution status: PASS. Coverage verdict: FAIL. Remediation status: NOT_STARTED.** Final answer: 7 HIGH archived ADG-dead tool capabilities remain unresolved with zero executable test proof. 2 items need owner decision. Builder: `build_w6_final_deliverables.py`.

### Wave 7 — Retirement-or-Remediation Decision Packet ✅ DONE

**Result**: All 9 unresolved items assessed with evidence-first analysis. All 7 HIGH gap source files read via filesystem MCP — **all are auto-generated scaffold stubs with zero real implementation** (generic `process()` returning `{"status":"processed"}`, undefined imports, uppercase variable bugs). Active substitute search confirmed governed alternatives exist: HOP1ProfileAnalysisAgent + profile_planner (personalization), L4 contracts (state), OTEL + L6 (metrics), PersonaPlannerValidator (validation). **Decisions: 7 RETIRE_WITH_RECEIPT, 2 OWNER_DECISION_REQUIRED** (w5_migration.py is a real 469-line migration utility; network_ops.py is a consolidated MCP mock file). W8 can proceed for retirement receipts. Builder: `build_w7_decision_packet.py`.

## Rules

- No code changes — this is a read-only audit
- Evidence-first: every claim backed by file path + symbol + line reference
- No unquarantining: quarantined files stay quarantined
- No fake receipts: if evidence is missing, mark MISSING
- Distinction: "in docs" ≠ "in runtime" ≠ "proven by tests"
- Tests are reference evidence, NOT contract-chain coverage
- Active replacement must match specific capability, not generic terms
- Constitutional spine laws are the arbiter of correctness

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] All quarantine-equivalent locations identified (in-tree + archives) — W1
- [x] Every quarantined file inventoried with path, type, purpose — W1 (109 items)
- [x] Capability classification complete (A-L buckets) — W2 (103 classified)
- [x] U0 packet coverage proven or gaps documented — W3 (17 U0, 9 field map)
- [x] Downstream contract coverage proven or gaps documented — W3–W4 (13 true gaps identified)
- [x] Test coverage evaluated for gap-relevant capabilities — W5 (7 HIGH: zero proof; 6 LOW: reference-only)
- [x] Final consolidated JSON receipt emitted — W6 (audit_execution=PASS, coverage=FAIL)
- [x] Final verdict rendered with proof — W6 (FAIL: 7 HIGH gaps, 2 owner decisions)
- [x] Retirement-or-remediation decisions for all 9 unresolved items — W7 (7 RETIRE, 2 OWNER)

## Cascade Alignment Checks

- Keep always-on rules lean; place detailed procedures in skills or workflows.
- Retrieve local or scoped evidence before synthesis.
- Prefer exact or structural matches before broad semantic expansion.
- For high-risk outputs, extract evidence or quotes before summarizing.
- Reserve deterministic enforcement for hooks or scripts, not template prose.
