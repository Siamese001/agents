# Audit Backlog Closeout — Read-Only Investigations

**Slug:** `agentic-core-eval-control-audit-backlog-closeout-e7f2a8`
**Parent reports:**
- `docs/reports/agentic_core_eval_control_audit/2026-05-02.md`
- `docs/reports/agentic_core_eval_control_audit/2026-05-02-per-module-followup.md`
- `docs/reports/agentic_core_eval_control_audit/2026-05-02-gap-closure.md`

**Sibling plan (already implemented):** `agentic-core-eval-implementation-d4e9c2` (closed F-2/F-3/F-4/F-5/P-1/P-2/P-4 via code).

**Date:** 2026-05-02
**Tier:** T0 (read-only investigation; single Markdown deliverable)
**Status:** Completed

## 1 · Why This Plan Exists

The implementation plan `d4e9c2` flagged 6 audit gaps as out-of-scope because they are read-only investigations that produce findings, not code changes:

- P-3: Trace `g22_output_quality.py` upstream scorer
- P-5: Verify L1 semantic judges abstain → HITL wiring
- P-6: Confirm `mixture_of_experts.py` / `ensemble_router.py` are not agent-swarm
- P-8: Confirm `_history_summarizer_llm.py` role
- F-1: Inspect `config/judges/trace_rubric.yaml`
- F-6: Deeper-read of two largest L5/reasoning files

This plan executes those investigations and emits a single closeout report.

## 2 · Hard Constraints

- Zero code changes.
- Zero patches.
- Zero refactors.
- Zero new Python files.
- Single Markdown deliverable at `docs/reports/agentic_core_eval_control_audit/2026-05-02-backlog-closeout.md`.

## 3 · Method (per item)

| Item | Method |
|---|---|
| P-3 | grep across `agentic_core/` for `groundedness` / `faithfulness` / `citation_support`; rank producers by match count; spot-read top hit |
| P-5 | grep `abstain` / `UNKNOWN` / `HITL` / `escalate` per L1 judge file |
| P-6 | read first 120 lines of each module; classify by name + signature |
| P-8 | read full file (small) |
| F-1 | read full YAML |
| F-6 | read first 60 lines of each (sufficient — confirmation, not deep audit) |

## 4 · Deliverable

`docs/reports/agentic_core_eval_control_audit/2026-05-02-backlog-closeout.md` with one section per item plus a summary table and final determination.

## 5 · Success Criteria

- All 6 items inspected with concrete evidence (line numbers / file sizes / match counts).
- Each item closed with one of: `confirmed correct`, `confirmed gap`, `audit reframed`, `severity revised`.
- No new code-change recommendations beyond what the prior reports already established.

## 6 · Wave Structure

| Wave | Phase | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | W1.1 | Parallel grep + read of all 6 items | done |
| W2 | W2.1 | Author closeout report | done |
| W3 | W3.1 | Move to canonical path; update Notion | done |

## 7 · Phase-Level Summary

| Phase ID | Title | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| W1.1 | Investigation | 6 source files / config files / grep sweeps | done |
| W2.1 | Report authoring | one Markdown file | done |
| W3.1 | Delivery | move + Notion flip | done |

## 8 · Boundary Compliance

This plan touches no code. All boundary invariants trivially preserved.

## 9 · Rollback

`git restore docs/reports/agentic_core_eval_control_audit/2026-05-02-backlog-closeout.md` if the file needs to be retracted. No code state to roll back.
