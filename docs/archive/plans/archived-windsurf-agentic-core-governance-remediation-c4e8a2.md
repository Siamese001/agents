# Agentic Core Governance Enforcement Remediation

Close the enforcement gaps identified in RCA of plan `agentic-core-static-apps-customization-governance-a1b2c3`.

## Problem Statement

The governance plan `a1b2c3` created enforcement mechanisms (rules, skills, hooks, tests) but **enforcement is not actually working** due to:

1. **CI gates not registered** — 6 governance tests exist but are NOT in `run_contract_gates.py`
2. **Test bugs** — `test_no_app_specific_literals_in_core.py` has broken negative controls
3. **Permissive hook logic** — `TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER` files auto-allowlisted without verified receipts
4. **323 pre-existing violations** — Massive leakage undetected by CI

**Hardening Mandate:**
Receipts must NOT become paper amnesty. Every exception requires explicit classification, owner-assignment, expiration-bound, CI-enforced, concrete migration path. Advisory mode has mandatory sunset.

---

## Context (SCQA)

**Situation** — Plan `a1b2c3` (agentic-core-static-apps-customization-governance) was marked Completed with claims of working enforcement: 6 governance tests, 5 hooks, 17 negative controls verified.

**Complication** — RCA reveals:
- Zero governance tests registered in CI (`run_contract_gates.py` has 40+ gates, none for agentic_core boundary)
- The literal scanning test has a bug that prevents it from running (negative control assertion failure)
- Hooks auto-allowlist `apps_*_*_binding.py` files without verifying migration receipts exist
- Fresh scan shows **323 violations** across 79 files in agentic_core

**Question** — How do we close these gaps and make enforcement actually functional?

**Answer** — Five-phase remediation: (1) Register CI gates with advisory mode, (2) Fix test bugs, (3) Harden hook receipt validation, (4) Triage violations with receipts for temporary adapters, (5) Verify enforcement works end-to-end.

- `artifacts/governance/migration_receipts/` (20 receipt files)

---

## W1: CI Gate Registration

### W1.P1 — Create `check_no_app_specific_literals_in_core.py`

**Location:** `ops_scripts/ci/check_no_app_specific_literals_in_core.py`

**Purpose:** Wrapper that runs `tests/governance/test_no_app_specific_literals_in_core.py` with proper `sys.path` setup.

**Acceptance:**
- Exit 0 when no CORE_APP_SPECIFIC_LEAKAGE detected
- Exit 0 with warnings when only TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER (with receipts) found
- Exit 1 (advisory mode) or 2 (fail-closed) for CORE_APP_SPECIFIC_LEAKAGE

### W1.P2 — Create `check_agentic_core_static_boundary.py`

**Location:** `ops_scripts/ci/check_agentic_core_static_boundary.py`

**Purpose:** Wrapper for `tests/governance/test_agentic_core_static_boundary.py`.

### W1.P3 — Create `check_apps_runtime_package_contracts.py`

**Location:** `ops_scripts/ci/check_apps_runtime_package_contracts.py`

**Purpose:** Wrapper for `tests/governance/test_apps_runtime_package_contracts.py`.

### W1.P4 — Create `check_governance_receipts.py`

**Location:** `ops_scripts/ci/check_governance_receipts.py`

**Purpose:** Validate all TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER files have migration receipts with:
- `binding_file` field matching path
- `classification` = "TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER"
- `migration_target_date` present and not expired

### W1.P5 — Register in `run_contract_gates.py`

**Edit:** `ops_scripts/ci/run_contract_gates.py`

**Add to `assurance_gates` list (advisory mode by default):**

```python
(
    "GOV-1 No app-specific literals in core (advisory)",
    "ops_scripts/ci/check_no_app_specific_literals_in_core.py",
),
(
    "GOV-2 Agentic core static boundary (advisory)",
    "ops_scripts/ci/check_agentic_core_static_boundary.py",
),
(
    "GOV-3 Apps runtime package contracts (advisory)",
    "ops_scripts/ci/check_apps_runtime_package_contracts.py",
),
(
    "GOV-4 Governance receipts valid (advisory)",
    "ops_scripts/ci/check_governance_receipts.py",
),
```

**Bypass env vars:**
- `GOV_LITERALS_BYPASS=1`
- `GOV_BOUNDARY_BYPASS=1`
- `GOV_PACKAGE_BYPASS=1`
- `GOV_RECEIPTS_BYPASS=1`

---

## W2: Test Bug Fixes

### W2.P1 — Fix Pattern Priority Bug

**File:** `tests/governance/test_no_app_specific_literals_in_core.py`

**Problem:** Line 303 assertion fails because `apps_rg` pattern matches before `app_id_branching` pattern.

**Fix:** Reorder `FORBIDDEN_LITERALS` dict so `app_id_branching` and `tenant_id_branching` are checked first (CRITICAL severity patterns before HIGH severity).

### W2.P2 — Fix Test File Exclusion

**Problem:** Negative control test expects `'/tests/test_foo.py'` to NOT match app patterns, but it does.

**Fix:** Add explicit test path check before pattern matching, or adjust negative control test case.

### W2.P3 — Verify All Tests Pass

**Command:**
```bash
python tests/governance/test_no_app_specific_literals_in_core.py
python tests/governance/test_agentic_core_static_boundary.py
python tests/governance/test_apps_runtime_package_contracts.py
python tests/governance/test_no_direct_l4_write_bypass.py
python tests/governance/test_no_app_exit_x3_emission.py
python tests/governance/test_governance_receipts.py
```

**Acceptance:** All 6 tests exit 0.

## W3: Hook Hardening

### W3.P1/W3.P2 — Harden `has_migration_receipt()`

**Files:**
- `tools/governance/core_write_guard.py` (lines 88-106)
- `tools/governance/core_leakage_scan.py` (similar function)

**Current logic:**
```python
def has_migration_receipt(binding_file: str) -> bool:
    if not MIGRATION_RECEIPTS_DIR.exists():
        return False
    # Looks for any JSON file with binding_file field
```

**Hardened logic with 12-field validation:**
```python
def has_migration_receipt(binding_file: str) -> Tuple[bool, Optional[str]]:
    """Returns (has_receipt, status_message)."""

            'test_coverage', 'approver', 'receipt_version'
        ]
        for field in required_12:
            if field not in receipt or not receipt[field]:
                return False, f"Receipt missing/empty field: {field}"
        
        # Owner exists validation
        if not _owner_exists(receipt['owner']):

        # Expiry CI-enforced validation
        if receipt['expiry_enforced_by_ci'] != True:
            return False, "expiry_enforced_by_ci must be true"
        
        # Test coverage validation
        for test_path in receipt['test_coverage']:
            if not Path(test_path).exists():
                return False, f"Referenced test not found: {test_path}"
        
        # Migration path non-empty
        if not receipt['migration_path'] or receipt['migration_path'].strip() == "":
            return False, "migration_path is empty"
        
        # Expiration check (FAIL if expired - no amnesty)
        target_date = receipt.get('migration_target_date')
        if target_date and target_date < datetime.now().isoformat()[:10]:
            return False, f"EXPIRED: Migration target date {target_date} has passed. Receipt invalid."
        
        return True, "Receipt valid (all 12 fields, CI-enforced, not expired)"
        
    except jsonschema.ValidationError as e:
        return False, f"Schema validation failed: {e.message}"
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, IOError) as e:
        return False, f"Receipt read error: {e}"
```

### W3.P3 — Advisory Mode with Mandatory Sunset

**Add to both scripts:**
```python
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Mandatory sunset: advisory mode expires 2026-06-15
ADVISORY_SUNSET = "2026-06-15"
ADVISORY_BYPASS_VAR = "GOV_TEMPORARY_BYPASS"

def get_enforcement_mode(cli_strict: bool) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    """Returns (is_strict, reason_message)."""
    today = datetime.now().isoformat()[:10]
    
    # After sunset, strict is default
    if today > ADVISORY_SUNSET:
        if os.environ.get(ADVISORY_BYPASS_VAR):
            return False, f"STRICT MODE ACTIVE (sunset {ADVISORY_SUNSET} passed). Bypass requires explicit operator justification in CI logs."
        return True, f"STRICT MODE (sunset {ADVISORY_SUNSET} enforced)"
    
    # Before sunset, advisory default
    if cli_strict:
        return True, "Strict mode (CLI flag)"
    
    return False, f"Advisory mode (sunset {ADVISORY_SUNSET})"

parser.add_argument('--strict', action='store_true', 
                    help='Fail-closed mode (post-sunset, this is default)')
args = parser.parse_args()

is_strict, mode_reason = get_enforcement_mode(args.strict)

if violations:
    if is_strict:
        print(f"FAIL: {mode_reason}")
        sys.exit(2)
    else:
        print(f"WARNING: Violations found ({mode_reason})")
        sys.exit(0)
```

### W3.P4 — Receipt Schema Validation (12 Mandatory Fields)

Create `tools/governance/schemas/migration_receipt.schema.json`:
```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",

  }
}
```

**CI Enforcement:** Expired receipts (migration_target_date < today) **MUST FAIL CI** with exit code 2.

## W4: Full Violation Classification (All 323)

### Invariant: Zero Unclassified Violations

Every violation must end in exactly one bucket:
- **CORE_APP_SPECIFIC_LEAKAGE** — Must fix or migrate
- **TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER** — Receipt-backed only, must prove thinness
- **FALSE_POSITIVE** — Documented rationale required
- **GENERIC_ALLOWED** — Registry pattern, documented governance exception

### W4.P1 — Parse Full Scan JSON

### Classification Buckets

**FALSE_POSITIVE** — Violations that match patterns but are not actual leakage:
- Test files, docs, receipts (already handled by allowlist)
- Generic registry that happens to mention app names
- Requires: `rationale` field explaining why not leakage

**GENERIC_ALLOWED** — App references in generic infrastructure:
- `agent_taxonomy_registry.py` — Generic owner registry pattern
- Path constants that map prefixes to layers
- Requires: `registry_pattern` documentation, `generic_justification`

**TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER** — True thin adapters with receipts:
- Must pass **Adapter-Boundary Rule** (see below)
- Requires: 12-field receipt, thinness proof, expiration date

**CORE_APP_SPECIFIC_LEAKAGE** — Everything else:
- Hardcoded business logic
- App-specific branching
- Policy embedded in generic code
- Requires: Migration plan to generic engine + app profile

### Adapter-Boundary Rule (Thinness Proof)

TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER classification requires proving:

```python
ADAPTER_ONLY_CRITERIA = {
    "no_business_logic": "No decision-making, no thresholds, no policy",
    "no_policy_branching": "No if/else on app_id or app-specific conditions",
    "no_orchestration": "No workflow sequencing, no state management",
    "no_durable_writes": "No direct L4 writes, all writes via UWG",
    "only_translation": "Pure binding: maps app profile to generic contract",
    "test_coverage": "Tests prove only translation behavior"
}
```

**Thinness Proof Process:**
1. Extract all function bodies from binding file
2. Check against ADAPTER_ONLY_CRITERIA
3. Any criterion fails → classify as LEAKAGE, not ADAPTER
4. Document passing criteria in receipt `adapter_only_justification`

### W4.P2-P5 — Process All 323 Violations

**Automated classification pass:**
- FALSE_POSITIVE: test files, docs, `__pycache__`
- GENERIC_ALLOWED: `agent_taxonomy_registry`, `ModuleOwnership`, `schema.py` mappings
- TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER: `*_binding.py` files (subject to thinness proof)
- CORE_APP_SPECIFIC_LEAKAGE: Everything else

**Manual review required for:**
- Borderline TEMPORARY vs LEAKAGE classifications
- Files with >20 matches (need thinness proof review)
- Generic registry patterns not yet documented

### W4.P6 — Create Hardened Receipts (12 Fields)

**Receipt template with all mandatory fields:**
```json
{
  "binding_file": "agentic_core/runtime/exit/apps_rg_exit_binding.py",
  "classification": "TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER",
  "owner": "agentic-core-team",

  "migration_target_date": "2026-06-30",
  "expiry_enforced_by_ci": true,
  "migration_path": "Migrate to generic exit_profile_enforcer.py consuming apps_rg/config/domain_contract/exit_profile.yaml. Remove hardcoded gate IDs G21-G28.",
  "blocking_migration_reason": "Exit profile schema not yet stabilized. apps_rg quarantine plan apps-rg-quarantine-gap-remediation-8f405c must complete Exit binding migration first.",
  "adapter_only_justification": "File contains only: (1) Exit gate ID constants mapping to generic gate names, (2) Profile path resolution, (3) Call to generic exit_eval hook. No business logic. No policy branching. No orchestration. No durable writes. Thiness verified by tests/_apps_contract/test_w7_exit_package_driven_binding.py.",
  "test_coverage": [
    "tests/_apps_contract/test_w7_exit_package_driven_binding.py",
    "tests/governance/test_no_app_specific_literals_in_core.py"
  ],
  "approver": "operator",
  "receipt_version": "1.0",
  "plan_id": "agentic-core-governance-remediation-c4e8a2",
  "rationale": "62 matches due to hardcoded gate IDs. True thin adapter pending generic exit profile enforcer implementation."
}
```

### W4.P7 — Generate Classification Report

**Output:** `artifacts/governance/violations_classification_c4e8a2.json`

```json
{
  "plan_id": "agentic-core-governance-remediation-c4e8a2",
  "total_violations": 323,
  "classification_summary": {
    "FALSE_POSITIVE": {"count": 45, "files": [...]},
    "GENERIC_ALLOWED": {"count": 38, "files": [...]},
    "TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER": {"count": 87, "files": [...], "receipt_count": 15},
    "CORE_APP_SPECIFIC_LEAKAGE": {"count": 153, "files": [...]}
  },
  "unclassified": 0,
  "expired_receipts": [],
  "receipts_without_thinness_proof": [],
  "created_at": "2026-05-11T20:00:00Z"
}
```

**Acceptance:** `unclassified` must be exactly 0.

### W5.P4 — Notion Update

**Action:** Update Plans DB row `agentic-core-governance-remediation-c4e8a2`:
- Status: Completed
- Summary: Hardened governance enforcement: 4 CI gates, 12-field receipts, advisory sunset 2026-06-15, 323 violations classified (0 unclassified).

---

## Hardening Summary (User Requirements Addressed)

### 1. Receipts NOT Paper Amnesty ✅
- 12 mandatory fields required
- `expiry_enforced_by_ci` must be `true` (enum validation)
- Expired receipts **FAIL CI** (exit 2)
- Owner must exist
- Migration path min 20 chars
- Thickness proof min 100 chars

### 2. All 323 Violations Classified ✅
- Exactly 4 buckets: CORE_APP_SPECIFIC_LEAKAGE, TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER, FALSE_POSITIVE, GENERIC_ALLOWED
- **Zero unclassified** invariant
- Classification report: `violations_classification_c4e8a2.json`
- Manual review for borderline cases

### 3. Advisory Mode Sunset ✅
- `ADVISORY_SUNSET = "2026-06-15"`
- Post-sunset: strict mode default
- Bypass requires `GOV_TEMPORARY_BYPASS` + explicit justification logged
- No permanent advisory loophole

### 4. Strong Receipt Validation ✅
- JSON Schema validation (jsonschema library)
- All 12 fields non-empty validation
- Owner existence check
- Test file existence check
- Classification enum validation
- Migration path non-empty + minLength
- **Expired = FAIL** (no amnesty)

### 5. Hardened DoD ✅
- 11 criteria (was 6)
- Includes: 0 CORE_APP_SPECIFIC_LEAKAGE, 0 TEMPORARY without receipt, 0 expired, 0 unclassified
- Explicit: "Zero unclassified violations."

### 6. Adapter Thickness Proof ✅
- `ADAPTER_ONLY_CRITERIA` documented
- Must prove: no business logic, no policy branching, no orchestration, no durable writes, only translation
- Tests must prove adapter-only behavior
- Thick files classified as LEAKAGE, not ADAPTER

---

## Rollback Strategy

If CI gates are too noisy:
1. Set bypass env vars in CI temporarily: `GOV_LITERALS_BYPASS=1`
2. Adjust thresholds in test files
3. Remove gates from `assurance_gates` list (preserve in wiring_gates as advisory)

## Hardened Definition of Done

| # | Criterion | Verification | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| DoD-1 | 4 CI gates (GOV-1..GOV-4) registered in `run_contract_gates.py` | `grep "GOV-" ops_scripts/ci/run_contract_gates.py` shows 4 matches | ⏳ |
| DoD-2 | Governance tests passing | All 6 tests exit 0 | ⏳ |
| DoD-3 | Hooks hardened with 12-field receipt validation | `has_migration_receipt()` validates all fields per schema | ⏳ |
| DoD-4 | 0 CORE_APP_SPECIFIC_LEAKAGE | Scan shows zero hardcoded app logic | ⏳ |
| DoD-5 | 0 TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER without valid receipt | All adapter receipts pass 12-field validation | ⏳ |
| DoD-6 | 0 expired receipts | No migration_target_date < today | ⏳ |
| DoD-7 | 0 unclassified violations | All 323 violations in exactly 1 bucket | ⏳ |
| DoD-8 | GOV-1..GOV-4 registered and passing in CI | `run_contract_gates.py` exits 0 with gates green | ⏳ |
| DoD-9 | Strict mode verified | `--strict` flag tested, sunset date set | ⏳ |
| DoD-10 | Classification report generated | `violations_classification_c4e8a2.json` exists with unclassified=0 | ⏳ |
| DoD-11 | Remediation receipt generated | `agentic-core-governance-remediation-c4e8a2_receipt.json` valid | ⏳ |

**DoD Invariant:** "Zero unclassified violations." Every one of the 323 findings must be explicitly bucketed with documented rationale.

## Cursor Agent Alignment Checks

- All new files follow SSOT routing (§31): `ops_scripts/ci/check_*.py`
- All edits follow pre-write hook discipline
- Receipts follow schema from `agentic-core-static.md`
- CI gates start advisory, can flip to fail-closed via env var
- Tests have negative controls verifying enforcement works
