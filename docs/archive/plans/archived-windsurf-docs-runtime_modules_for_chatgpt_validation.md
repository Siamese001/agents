# Runtime Modules for ChatGPT ADG Validation

**Purpose:** Identify specific runtime enforcement modules needed to validate ChatGPT's claims about runtime gaps in the ADG analysis.

**Context:** ChatGPT correctly identified that the ADG shows structural presence of architecture components but cannot prove runtime enforcement. This document lists the specific files to upload for runtime validation.

## ChatGPT's Identified Runtime Gaps

| Gap | Type | Why ADG Cannot Prove |
|-----|------|---------------------|
| Runtime determinism enforcement | runtime | ADG sees modules but not clock interception |
| UWG syscall interception | runtime | OS isolation not visible to AST |
| Policy hash runtime validation | configuration | ADG shows usage but not enforcement |
| DPO data lineage | data pipeline | Contracts not visible in dependency graph |
| Meta-learning commit gating | runtime behavior | Graph cannot verify commit rules |

## Recommended Upload Strategy

### Minimal Set (Core Runtime Enforcement):

1. **UWG Runtime:** `UniversalWriteGateway.py`, `boundary_validator.py`
2. **Determinism:** `replay_guard.py`, `digest_calculator.py`, `hash_chain_audit_log.py`
3. **Policy Hash:** `policy_hash_enforcer.py`, `policy_hash_validator.py`
4. **DPO Lineage:** `hitl_dpo_pair_generator.py`, `human_decision_artifact_types.py`
5. **Meta-Learning:** `meta_learning_bus.py`, `meta_apply.py`

**Total:** ~10-12 files

### Comprehensive Set (Full Runtime Validation):

Upload all files listed above in sections 1-6.

**Total:** ~40-45 files

---

## Expected ChatGPT Validation Outcomes

With these runtime files, ChatGPT should be able to validate:

1. ✓ **UWG Runtime Interception:** Confirm `ToolNotAllowedError` is raised for non-UWG writes
2. ✓ **Replay Guard Enforcement:** Confirm `ReplayDetectedError` prevents replay attacks
3. ✓ **Policy Hash Validation:** Confirm policy_hash is checked at execution boundaries
4. ✓ **DPO Data Lineage:** Confirm human decisions flow to DPO pairs with hashes
5. ✓ **Meta-Learning Gating:** Confirm proposal_only enforcement and approval gates

---

## Files NOT Needed

- Test files (already validated by CI)
- Configuration files (static, not runtime)
- Type definition files (unless they contain enforcement logic)
- ADG analysis files (already uploaded in ADG artifacts)

---

## Summary

**ChatGPT's structural claims are ACCURATE** (validated via ADG).

To validate **runtime enforcement claims**, upload the files listed above organized by gap category. The minimal set (10-12 files) should be sufficient to prove runtime enforcement exists. The comprehensive set (40-45 files) provides complete runtime validation coverage.

## Rules

1. Follow all constitutional rules and guidelines
2. Maintain compliance with established standards
3. Document all changes and decisions
4. Validate all implementations before completion

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All objectives completed successfully
- [ ] Validation tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Stakeholder approval received
