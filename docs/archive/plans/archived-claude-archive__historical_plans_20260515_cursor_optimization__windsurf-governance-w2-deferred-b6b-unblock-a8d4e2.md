# W2 Hook Consolidation — B6B Shadow Mode Unblock

> **RETIRED 2026-05-12 — STALE PREMISE**
> This plan was superseded before activation. W1C risk acceptance R4 (09:30Z 2026-05-12) formally waived
> the B6B 14-day shadow requirement and substituted C1-C6 phase-local controls. W2.P0 was issued
> GO_WITH_CONTROLS at 09:40Z and W2.P1-P5 completed by 10:30Z. This plan's W0 and W1 phases were
> never executed and are now moot.
>
> Preservation: B6B shadow runner and manifest remain active for post-W2 monitoring.
> Future scope: Any further hook consolidation (59→20 target) requires new plan + Author-Gate.
> Reconciliation index: `artifacts/b6b/w2_b6b_reconciliation_index.md`
> Retirement receipt: `artifacts/b6b/deferred_plan_retirement_receipt.md`

> ~~**CURRENT STATUS**: W2 BLOCKED ⛔ on B6B (shadow mode) | Parent plan W5 COMPLETE ✅ | Unblock requires 14+ days shadow data + harness fix~~ *(superseded — see retirement notice above)*

> ~~**DEPENDENCY**: This plan is gated by B6B shadow mode completion. Cannot start until B6A validation harness issues resolved AND 14+ days of production shadow data collected.~~ *(moot — plan retired; W1C R4 waived both requirements before W2.P0)*

## 1. Problem Statement

W2 Hook Consolidation was **intentionally blocked** in parent plan `windsurf-governance-consolidation-a7c3e9` due to unresolved B6B blocker.

**B6A Status**: ✅ RESOLVED — Harness sys.path fix applied in W1B.P2. 21 hooks validated. Receipt: `artifacts/b6a/b6a_harness_fix_receipt.md`.

**B6B Requirement**: ✅ WAIVED (W1C R4, 2026-05-12T09:30Z) — 14-day shadow requirement replaced by C1-C6 phase-local controls before W2.P0 was issued. Shadow runner exists for post-W2 monitoring only.

**OP-1 Status**: ✅ CLOSED — Loader priority proven via physical reordering in W1B.P3.

**W2 Consolidation Status**: ✅ COMPLETE — W2.P1-P5 executed under W1C R4 waiver + C1-C6 controls. 7 survivor hooks, 22 replacement_for[] entries, zero enforcement loss. This plan's scope was never activated; W2 ran via parent plan `windsurf-governance-consolidation-a7c3e9`.

## 2. Goals & Success Criteria

### P1: Unblock W2 (Primary) — MOOT
- [x] ~~B6B shadow mode completes 14+ days data collection~~ *(waived by W1C R4)*
- [x] ~~35 SHADOW_REQUIRED hooks validated in production~~ *(replaced by C4 phase-local validation)*
- [x] ~~Golden receipts match for all 35 hooks~~ *(C2/C3 controls satisfied per phase)*
- [x] W2.P0 re-authorized with GO status *(issued GO_WITH_CONTROLS 2026-05-12T09:40Z)*

### P2: Execute W2 Consolidation — COMPLETE (via parent plan, not this plan)
- [x] W2.P1-P5 consolidated under C1-C6 controls
- [x] 7 survivor hooks, 22 hooks mapped in replacement_for[]
- [x] Zero enforcement loss proven (`w2_final_consolidation_receipt.json`)
- [x] All replacement_for[] mappings valid (C1 verified)
- [ ] ~~59→~20 hooks consolidated (70% reduction target)~~ *(NOT executed — future scope, requires new plan + Author-Gate)*

### P3: Closeout — COMPLETE (via parent plan)
- [x] W2 FINAL closeout receipt (`w2_final_consolidation_receipt.json`)
- [x] No orphaned behaviors verified (C2/C3 per phase)
- [x] CI gates pass (43 gates)

## 3. Non-Goals (Out-of-Scope)

1. **NO new hook creation** — consolidation only
2. **NO rule changes** — W3 already complete
3. **NO skill changes** — W4 already complete
4. **NO index automation changes** — W5 already complete
5. **NO constitutional changes** — §0-§36 remain untouched

## 6. Blocker Register

| Blocker ID | Description | Resolution | Status |
|------------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **B6B** | Shadow mode 14+ days required | W1C R4 waiver — phase-local C1-C6 controls substituted | ✅ WAIVED 2026-05-12T09:30Z |

## 7. Related Plans & Dependencies

| Plan | Slug | Relation |
|------|------|----------|
| Parent Governance Plan | windsurf-governance-consolidation-a7c3e9 | Deferred from W2 |
| Author-Gate Pipeline | author-gate-pipeline-hardening-d7e3f9 | W1.P2 dependency |

## 8. Verification-vs-Deferral

| Item | Verify Now | Defer | Rationale |
|------|------------|-------|-----------|
| B6B shadow activation | — | ⏹️ MOOT | W1C R4 waived this requirement; runner available for post-W2 monitoring |
| 14-day data collection | — | ⏹️ MOOT | Waived; shadow data is post-W2 observational evidence only |
| W2 consolidation logic | ✅ | — | Proven and completed in parent plan W2.P1-P5 |

## 9. Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Final Status |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| B6A harness fix takes >1 week | Medium | High | Parallel track: fix harness while W5 completed | ✅ CLOSED — Fixed in W1B.P2 same day |
| Shadow data shows hook bugs | Low | High | Fail-soft receipts already in place | ✅ CLOSED — W2 ran under C1-C6; zero enforcement loss |
| 14-day delay pushes to next sprint | High | Low | This plan captures the deferral explicitly | ✅ CLOSED — W1C R4 waiver eliminated the 14-day wait |
