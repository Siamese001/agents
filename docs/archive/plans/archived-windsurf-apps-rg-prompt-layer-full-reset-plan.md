> **Status**: Not Started  
> **Risk Classification**: T3 — Architectural (prompt layer governance)  
> **Parent Plan**: `apps-rg-pa-w10-5-section-signal-hardening-d9b3e7`

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This plan governs a **full reset** of the apps_rg resume generation prompt layer. Current prompts are **UNTRUSTED** until proven compliant with the canonical requirements below. This is a gap-analysis and replacement-plan task — **no implementation changes** outside the plan artifact until waves are approved.

### Hardening Rules (Non-Negotiable)

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| **W1 Plan-Only** | W1 defines retirement strategy only — NO editing of existing YAML templates |
| **No agentic_core Changes** | Zero edits to `agentic_core/` including legacy shims; app-local bindings created under `apps_rg/runtime/bindings/` only |
| **Monolith Decommission Gate** | CI fails if any runtime path invokes monolithic full-resume prompt for generation |
| **Deterministic Copy Bypass** | Locked sections bypass L2 model generation entirely — no `locked_copy_*.yaml` prompts |
| **Receipt Per Wave** | Each wave produces receipt artifact with diff confirmation, test results, monolith status |
| **Test-First Grouping** | 40 test cases grouped into 8 domain files, not 40 separate files |
| **Tightened DoD** | 22 DoD items enforce section-specific lanes, claim ledgers, locked section preservation |
| **Base Resume SSOT** | Canonical frozen base resume **JSON** is runtime SSOT; DOCX only for creation/validation; refresh is versioned workflow |
| **Canonical JSON Paths** | `apps_rg/resume/base/amit_ayer_base_resume_v1.json` + `active_base_resume_pointer.json` |
| **STOP 0-15 Gates** | 16 mandatory stop points with receipts; no next wave until prior STOP is PASS |
| **Lane Temperature** | Per-lane temperature profiles; calibrated via sweep; highest passing temp selected |
| **Section Metrics** | Global metric suite, section-granular tracking, threshold profiles per lane |
| **Section Source Hashes** | Every section carries base_section_hash, input_payload_hash, output_payload_hash, claim_ledger_hash |
| **Explicit L2 Count** | Exactly 18 L2 executions + 2 deterministic non-model nodes |
| **L3 Orchestration** | 22-step managed workflow with explicit order, dependencies, stop conditions |
| **No Patch Rule** | Create canonical prompts from scratch; old prompts are reference-only |
| **Runtime Payload Tests** | Tests prove section isolation and payload boundaries |

### Current State Finding

| Dimension | Finding |
|-----------|---------|
| **Prompt Layer Trust Status** | **UNTRUSTED** — Current prompts violate canonical requirements in multiple dimensions |
| **L2 Architecture** | **MONOLITHIC** — `strategic_tailor_v1` attempts full-resume generation; no section-specific lanes exist |
| **v1/v2 Variant Status** | **MIXED** — Only v1 templates exist; required v2 templates for section-specific workflow do not exist |
| **Section-Specific Lanes** | **ABSENT** — No bounded lanes for strategic planning, headline, bullets, narratives, competencies |
| **Deterministic Copy Enforcement** | **UNVERIFIED** — No runtime wiring proof that locked sections bypass LLM generation |
| **Claim Ledger Output** | **PARTIAL** — Some templates have citation preservation; no structured claim ledger with fact_id mapping |

---

## 2. Canonical Requirements (Source of Truth)

### 2.1 Non-Monolithic L2 Architecture

Resume customization **MUST** split into bounded section-specific lanes:

| # | Lane ID | Purpose | Output Contract |
|---|---------|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | `strategic_tailor_v2` | Planning only — **NO final resume prose** | target_signal_map, jd_requirement_map, briefing_signal_map, allowed_fact_ids_by_section, forbidden_claims, vocabulary_map, gap_list, section_budget |
| 2 | `headline_tailor_v1` | Global resume headline only | X \| Y \| Z (3 pipe-separated segments, 8-11 words total) |
| 3 | `executive_summary.generate_scratch_v1` | Generate from verified facts only | executive_summary, selected_fact_plan, claim_ledger, jd_alignment, gap_notes, self_check |
| 4 | `unify_bullet_tailor_v1` | Unify experience bullets — exactly 6 bullets | 6 bullets with HEAVY/MODERATE/LIGHT_PROTECTED distribution (2/3/1 default) |
| 5 | `unify_position_narrative_v1` | Unify role narrative — exactly 1 sentence | One elevator-style sentence, complements bullets without repetition |
| 6 | `ibm_bullet_tailor_v1` | IBM bullets — exactly 5 bullets | 5 bullets with MODERATE/LIGHT_PROTECTED only (no HEAVY) |
| 7 | `ibm_position_narrative_v1` | IBM narrative — exactly 1 sentence | One sentence, no Unify-specific runtime terms unless IBM facts support |
| 8 | `competency_selector_v2` | Exactly 8 competency categories | Category Label: term, term format; no sentences; excluded_jd_skills list |
| 9 | `final unify_v2` | Consistency pass only — **NO new content authority** | Resolved duplicates, drift fixes, no locked section modification |
| 10 | `unsupported_claim_omission_v2` | Final validator — block unsupported claims | omission_report, claim_ledger validated |
| 11 | `resume_fact_check_v2` | Final validator — fact-check all claims | verification_report, unsupported_claims, suggested_corrections |
| 12 | `docx_manifest_v2` | DOCX render manifest | Section mapping, locked section preservation proof, render directives |

### 2.2 Locked Deterministic Copy Sections

These sections **MUST bypass LLM generation entirely** — byte-for-byte preservation:

| Section | Fields Locked |
|---------|---------------|
| InsurTech role | company, location, title, dates, narrative, bullets |
| EY role | company, location, title, dates, narrative, bullets |
| Early Career role | company, location, title, dates, bullets |
| Education | institution, degree, dates, GPA (if present) |
| Certifications & Credentials | certification name, issuer, date, credential ID |

**Locked deterministic copy fields across ALL roles:**
- `company_name` — never rewritten
- `location` — never rewritten
- `historical_title` — never rewritten
- `dates` — never rewritten

### 2.3 Global Prompt Law

Every prompt **MUST** enforce:

| Rule | Violation Consequence |
|------|----------------------|
| JD and company briefing are **targeting context only** | If JD becomes proof → FAIL |
| JD and company briefing are **never proof of candidate experience** | If briefing supports claims → FAIL |
| Every material claim **must trace to candidate_fact_map, verified_skill_inventory, or base resume facts** | If untraced claim present → FAIL |
| Unsupported JD requirements are **reported as gaps, not fabricated** | If gap filled with fabrication → FAIL |
| No unsupported tools, frameworks, platforms, model names, compliance terms, industries, certifications, clients, metrics, revenue, team size, dates, titles, or outcomes | If any unsupported present → FAIL |
| **No em dash** — use comma or restructure | If em dash present → FAIL |
| Do not copy **more than 4 consecutive words** from the JD | If >4 consecutive JD words → FAIL |
| Preserve base resume rigor, density, seniority, technical richness, commercial credibility, and human-written tone | If tone flattened to generic leadership → FAIL |
| Do not flatten technical proof into generic leadership language | If technical specifics lost → FAIL |
| Do not keyword stuff | If JD keyword stuffing detected → FAIL |

### 2.4 Base Resume SSOT Rule (JSON — Critical Anti-Drift Control)

The **canonical frozen base resume JSON** is the **runtime SSOT**, not DOCX.

**Canonical JSON Design:**

| Component | Path | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Base Resume JSON** | `apps_rg/resume/base/amit_ayer_base_resume_v1.json` | Immutable canonical resume structure |
| **Active Pointer** | `apps_rg/resume/base/active_base_resume_pointer.json` | Runtime reference to current version |

**Runtime Load Requirements:**
Every JD customization MUST load:
- `base_resume_json_ref` — pointer to canonical JSON
- `base_resume_json_hash` — SHA256 of canonical JSON
- `base_resume_schema_version` — schema validation
- `base_section_hashes` — per-section source hashes
- `locked_copy_hashes` — locked section integrity hashes

**DOCX Usage Rules:**
- DOCX may be used **ONLY** to create or validate the canonical JSON
- Normal JD customization **MUST NOT** repeatedly parse DOCX
- Normal JD customization **MUST NOT** mutate canonical JSON
- If DOCX and canonical JSON conflict during runtime → **FAIL** (unless explicit base resume refresh workflow run)

**Authority Hierarchy:**

| Source | Authority Status | Conflict Resolution |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Canonical base resume JSON** | ✅ **SSOT — AUTHORITATIVE** | Wins all conflicts |
| Older `master_resume.json` | ❌ NON-AUTHORITATIVE | Blocked unless explicitly conflict-cleared |
| Prior resume files | ❌ NON-AUTHORITATIVE | Cannot feed candidate_fact_map |
| Cached bullet pools | ❌ NON-AUTHORITATIVE | Ignored unless mapped and validated |
| Historical candidate facts | ❌ NON-AUTHORITATIVE | Require explicit conflict resolution |
| **DOCX** (during normal customization) | ❌ **NON-AUTHORITATIVE** | Load JSON only; DOCX for refresh workflow only |

**Base Resume Refresh Workflow (Versioned):**
1. Ingest approved new base resume DOCX
2. Generate candidate `base_resume_json`
3. Diff against prior canonical JSON
4. Require human approval
5. Write new version (e.g., `amit_ayer_base_resume_v2.json`)
6. Update `active_base_resume_pointer`
7. Emit `base_resume_refresh_receipt`

**SSOT Tests Required:**
- Runtime loads canonical JSON by ref and hash
- Runtime does not parse DOCX during normal JD customization
- `candidate_fact_map` traces to canonical JSON fact IDs
- `verified_skill_inventory` traces to canonical JSON fact IDs
- Section prompts receive only section-scoped JSON slices
- Locked sections copied from canonical JSON byte-for-byte
- DOCX manifest fails if locked text differs from canonical JSON
- Conflicting older `master_resume.json` cannot override canonical JSON
- Canonical JSON cannot be mutated during JD tailoring
- Base resume refresh requires explicit versioned workflow

### 2.5 Section Source Hash Requirements

Every section packet **MUST** carry cryptographic source hashes:

| Hash Field | Purpose | Validation Point |
|------------|---------|------------------|
| `base_section_hash` | Hash of source section from base resume | L3 input freeze |
| `input_payload_hash` | Hash of prompt + context + allowed_fact_ids | Pre-L2 execution |
| `output_payload_hash` | Hash of raw model output | Post-L2 execution |
| `claim_ledger_hash` | Hash of structured claim_ledger | Post-validation |
| `locked_copy_hash` | Hash of deterministic locked section copy | DOCX manifest |

**DOCX manifest MUST validate** `locked_copy_hash` against base resume source hash. Mismatch = hard fail before render.

### 2.6 Deterministic Copy Architecture (No Model Prompts for Locked Sections)

Locked sections **MUST NOT** enter any model prompt payload as writable text. They bypass L2 model generation entirely:

| Locked Section | Source of Truth | Validation Point |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| InsurTech full section | Base resume structured data | L4 deterministic copy contract |
| EY full section | Base resume structured data | L4 deterministic copy contract |
| Early Career full section | Base resume structured data | L4 deterministic copy contract |
| Education | Base resume structured data | L4 deterministic copy contract |
| Certifications & Credentials | Base resume structured data | L4 deterministic copy contract |

**Locked fields across all roles (read-only in all prompts):**
- `company` — sourced from base resume, never writable
- `location` — sourced from base resume, never writable
- `historical_title` — sourced from base resume, never writable
- `dates` — sourced from base resume, never writable

**NO `locked_copy_*.yaml` model prompts will be created.** Locked sections flow through runtime deterministic copy contracts and are validated at DOCX manifest generation.

**Locked Copy Assembler** (deterministic non-model node):
- InsurTech full section (company, location, title, dates, narrative, bullets)
- EY full section
- Early Career full section
- Education
- Certifications & Credentials
- All role headers (company, location, historical_title, dates)

### 2.7 Explicit L2 Execution Count (18 + 2)

**Generation/Selector Lanes (8):**
1. `strategic_tailor_v2` — planning only
2. `headline_tailor_v1` — X | Y | Z headline
3. `executive_summary.generate_scratch_v1` — evidence-first summary
4. `unify_bullet_tailor_v1` — 6 bullets
5. `unify_position_narrative_v1` — 1 sentence
6. `ibm_bullet_tailor_v1` — 5 bullets
7. `ibm_position_narrative_v1` — 1 sentence
8. `competency_selector_v2` — 8 categories

**Validator Lanes (7):**
9. Executive summary fact check
10. Executive summary unsupported/omission check
11. Unify bullet fact check
12. Unify narrative fact check
13. IBM bullet fact check
14. IBM narrative fact check
15. Competency fact check

**Final Control Lanes (3):**
16. `final_unify_v2` — consistency only, no new content authority
17. `unsupported_claim_omission_v2` — final
18. `resume_fact_check_v2` — final

**Deterministic Non-Model Nodes (2):**
19. Locked copy assembler
20. DOCX manifest validator

**Optional L2 Repair Lanes (0-2):**
- `bullet_diversity_repair_v2` for Unify (only if needed, before fact check)
- `bullet_diversity_repair_v2` for IBM (only if needed, before fact check)

**Total Required L2 Executions: 18**
**Total Deterministic Non-Model Nodes: 2**

### 2.8 L3 Managed Workflow Orchestration Order (22 Steps)

L3 **MUST** enforce this exact execution order with dependencies and stop conditions:

| Step | L2/Node | Purpose | Stop Condition |
|------|---------|---------|----------------|
| 0 | **L3 Parse & Freeze** | Parse inputs, freeze base_resume_ssot_ref, compute base_section_hashes | Any parse error |
| 1 | `strategic_tailor_v2` | Planning only, emits allowed_fact_ids_by_section | Planning failure |
| 2 | `headline_tailor_v1` | X \| Y \| Z headline, 8-11 words | Format violation |
| 3 | `executive_summary.generate_scratch_v1` | Evidence-first summary generation | Evidence trace failure |
| 4 | `resume_fact_check_v2` | Fact check summary claims | Unsupported claim found |
| 5 | `unsupported_claim_omission_v2` | Omission check on summary | Unresolvable claim |
| 6 | `unify_bullet_tailor_v1` | Generate 6 Unify bullets | Wrong bullet count |
| 7 | `bullet_diversity_repair_v2` (optional) | Repair only if repetition detected | N/A — optional |
| 8 | `resume_fact_check_v2` | Fact check Unify bullets | Unsupported bullet claim |
| 9 | `unify_position_narrative_v1` | Generate 1-sentence Unify narrative | Multiple sentences |
| 10 | `resume_fact_check_v2` | Fact check Unify narrative | New claim introduced |
| 11 | `ibm_bullet_tailor_v1` | Generate 5 IBM bullets | Wrong bullet count |
| 12 | `bullet_diversity_repair_v2` (optional) | Repair only if repetition detected | N/A — optional |
| 13 | `resume_fact_check_v2` | Fact check IBM bullets | Unsupported bullet claim |
| 14 | `ibm_position_narrative_v1` | Generate 1-sentence IBM narrative | Unify term contamination |
| 15 | `resume_fact_check_v2` | Fact check IBM narrative | New claim introduced |
| 16 | **Locked Copy Assembler** | Deterministic assembly of locked sections | Hash mismatch |
| 17 | `competency_selector_v2` | Generate 8 competency categories | Wrong category count |
| 18 | `resume_fact_check_v2` | Fact check competencies | Bullet restatement |
| 19 | `final_unify_v2` | Consistency pass, no new content | Net-new claim detected |
| 20 | `unsupported_claim_omission_v2` | Final omission check | Unresolvable claim |
| 21 | `resume_fact_check_v2` | Final fact check | Any unsupported claim |
| 22 | **DOCX Manifest Validator** | Validate all hashes, locked copy, render | Any hash mismatch |

**Dependency Rules:**
- Narrative lanes (steps 9, 14) **MUST NOT** start until bullet fact checks (steps 8, 13) pass
- Final validators (steps 19-21) **MUST NOT** start until all generation lanes complete
- DOCX manifest (step 22) **MUST** validate `locked_copy_hash` against base resume

### 2.9 Hardened Unify Rules (6 Bullets)

| Rule | Constraint | Violation |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Bullet count | Exactly 6 | Not 6 = hard fail |
| Rewrite distribution | 2 HEAVY / 3 MODERATE / 1 LIGHT_PROTECTED | Wrong distribution = soft fail |
| Max HEAVY | 3 (hard limit) | >3 HEAVY = hard fail |
| Min LIGHT_PROTECTED | 1 (hard minimum) | <1 LIGHT = hard fail |
| Default LIGHT_PROTECTED | **Platform Commercialization and Engineering Leadership** bullet | Protected unless strategic_tailor_plan proves otherwise |
| Protected metrics | $22M revenue expansion, 20% margin improvement, 6mo→3wk deployment, 8→28 team scale | Any metric change = hard fail |
| Bullet scope | Bullets only — NO narrative text | Narrative in bullet prompt = hard fail |
| Citation | Every bullet MUST cite source_fact_ids | Missing citation = hard fail |

**Unify LIGHT_PROTECTED Default Rationale:**
The Platform Commercialization bullet carries the highest-value proof ($22M, margin expansion, team scaling). It should only be rewritten if strategic_tailor_plan explicitly identifies a safer bullet to protect.

### 2.10 Hardened IBM Rules (5 Bullets)

| Rule | Constraint | Violation |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Bullet count | Exactly 5 | Not 5 = hard fail |
| HEAVY rewrites | **FORBIDDEN** — 0 HEAVY | Any HEAVY = hard fail |
| Rewrite distribution | 3 MODERATE / 2 LIGHT_PROTECTED | Wrong distribution = soft fail |
| Content domain | Enterprise-scale cloud, data, AI platform, regulated financial services, lineage, observability, portfolio, partnership | Off-domain terms = hard fail |
| Forbidden terms (unless in IBM source facts) | agentic AI, GraphRAG, multi-agent orchestration, deterministic routing, sandboxed execution, replayable traces, governed AI runtime, prompt assembly, C0, L2, Exit, UWG | Forbidden term use = hard fail |
| Narrative isolation | IBM narrative runs AFTER IBM bullet fact check, must not import Unify runtime claims | Unify term contamination = hard fail |
| Citation | Every bullet MUST cite source_fact_ids | Missing citation = hard fail |

### 2.11 Hardened Narrative Prompt Rules (Both Unify and IBM)

| Rule | Constraint | Violation |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Execution order | Run AFTER bullet generation AND bullet fact check | Wrong order = workflow fail |
| Length | Exactly 1 sentence | Multiple sentences = hard fail |
| Style | Elevator-style, catchy but not salesy | Too salesy = soft fail |
| Relationship to bullets | Complement bullets, do NOT summarize them | Summary repetition = hard fail |
| Metric repetition | Do NOT repeat bullet metrics | Metric copied = hard fail |
| Label repetition | Do NOT repeat bullet labels unless specifically justified | Label copied = hard fail |
| Structure | Do NOT copy bullet sentence structure | Parallel structure = soft fail |
| Claims | Do NOT introduce new claims not supported by role allowed facts or fact-checked bullets | New unsupported claim = hard fail |
| Numbers | NO numbers unless already present in base narrative or explicitly allowed | New number = hard fail |

### 2.12 Hardened Competency Selector Rules

| Rule | Constraint | Violation |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Category count | Exactly 8 | Not 8 = hard fail |
| Format | `Category Label: term, term, term` | Full sentences = hard fail |
| Sentence prohibition | NO full sentences, NO bullets, NO keyword stuffing | Violation = hard fail |
| Purpose | Augment bullets, NOT restate them | Pure restatement = hard fail |
| Source tracking | Every term MUST map to source_fact_ids | Missing source = hard fail |
| Overlap check | Compute overlap against finalized bullets | |
| — Rejection threshold | Reject term if it repeats a bullet outcome | Outcome overlap = hard fail |
| — Compression threshold | Reject or compress if >5 consecutive words from a bullet | Word overlap = hard fail |
| JD handling | JD-only skills → `excluded_jd_skills` list | JD skill in output = hard fail |
| Variant collapse | Duplicate variants → one strongest supported term | Duplicate present = soft fail |

**Good vs Bad Competency Example:**
- **BAD:** `AI CI/CD: six-month to three-week deployment reduction` (repeats bullet outcome)
- **GOOD:** `AI CI/CD: release gating, deployment lifecycle standardization` (underlying capability)

### 2.13 Neutered final_unify_v2 (Consistency Pass Only)

**final_unify_v2** has **NO net-new content authority**. It is a consistency editor only.

**ALLOWED Operations:**
- Remove duplicate claim
- Normalize same metric wording (e.g., "$22M" → "$22 million" consistently)
- Resolve terminology drift (e.g., "AI platform" vs "AI platforms")
- Fix section ordering
- Flag issue for human review

**FORBIDDEN Operations:**
- Add new claim (any claim not in input)
- Add new metric (any number not in input)
- Add new skill (any skill not in input)
- Modify locked sections (InsurTech, EY, Early Career, Education, Certs)
- Rewrite Unify or IBM substance (preserves fact-checked content)
- Change copied headers (company, location, title, dates)
- Alter source_fact_ids (preserves evidence trace)
- Alter claim ledger support status (preserves verification state)

**Detection:** If final_unify_v2 output hash shows net-new content vs input, workflow MUST fail before DOCX render.

### 2.14 Required Output Schema Fields

Every generated section **MUST** emit:

| Field | Required In |
|-------|---------------|
| `claim_ledger` — list of claims with source_fact_ids | All generation prompts (summary, bullets, narratives, competencies) |
| `gap_notes` — list of unsupported JD requirements | All generation prompts |
| `change_log` — record of modifications made | All generation prompts |
| `self_check` — prompt self-verification results | All generation prompts |
| `selected_fact_plan` — evidence-first selection before drafting | executive_summary only |
| `jd_alignment` — explicit mapping to JD requirements | executive_summary only |

---

## 3. Section Proof Gates and Mandatory Stop Points (STOP 0-15)

Each stop point **MUST** produce a receipt under `artifacts/apps_rg/prompt_reset/`. **No next wave may begin until the prior stop point is PASS.** PARTIAL means stop.

| Unsupported JD → gap_notes | No fabrication |
| **Negative tests** | Briefing-as-proof, unsupported metric, JD phrase copy, em dash → FAIL |

### STOP 4A: Canonical Prompt Export and ChatGPT Review Gate (MANDATORY)

**Purpose:** Before implementation wiring, Windsurf exports exact canonical prompt templates for external review by ChatGPT. This is a **hard stop** because prompt precision, temperature posture, section boundaries, and hallucination controls are the highest-risk part of the reset.

**Sequencing:** STOP 4A occurs **after W2A, W2B, W2C, and W2D are complete** — all canonical prompts must exist before export for review. The critical prompts `unify_position_narrative_v1` (W2B) and `competency_selector_v2` (W2D) must be drafted before STOP 4A can proceed.

**This stop is mandatory before:** runtime routing, registry activation, or L2 orchestration wiring.

#### Critical Prompts Requiring Explicit ChatGPT Review

| Priority | Prompt ID | Why Critical |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **CRITICAL** | `executive_summary.generate_scratch_v1` | Evidence-first flow, no word count, JD-as-target-only |
| **CRITICAL** | `unify_position_narrative_v1` | One-sentence elevator pitch, anti-repetition, no new claims |
| **CRITICAL** | `competency_selector_v2` | 8-category taxonomy, ATS optimization, no bullet restatement |
| Context | `unify_bullet_tailor_v1` | Bullet distribution, rewrite intensity |
| Context | `ibm_bullet_tailor_v1` | Conservative enterprise tone, no HEAVY |
| Context | `ibm_position_narrative_v1` | IBM narrative isolation |
| Context | `headline_tailor_v1` | X \| Y \| Z format, 8-11 words |
| Context | `strategic_tailor_v2` | Planning-only, no resume prose |

#### Hard Stop Rules

- **Do not wire prompts into runtime** before this stop passes
- **Do not update prompt registry** before this stop passes (draft/inactive entries only if needed)
- **Do not run implementation** beyond prompt authoring before this stop passes
- **Do not claim STOP 4A PASS** until ChatGPT review feedback is incorporated or explicitly waived by Amit
- **If ChatGPT identifies** precision, temperature, payload scope, schema, hallucination, overfitting, ATS, or deterministic-copy issues → mark STOP 4A **PARTIAL** and stop

## 4. Lane Temperature Profiles and Calibration

### Temperature Principles

- **No global temperature** — each L2 lane has its own profile
- **Deterministic copy lanes** — no model, no temperature
- **Validator lanes** — default to 0.0
- **Final unify** — 0.0 to 0.1, no new content authority
- **Higher temperature allowed only** where language quality benefits from variation
- **Temperature must be proven by tests**, not guessed
- **Selected temperature stored** in `lane_temperature_profile`
- **Runtime receipts include:** temperature, model, provider, seed, prompt hash, input hash, output hash, gate result

### Default Lane Temperature Profile

| Lane | Temperature Range | Rationale |
|------|-------------------|-----------|
| `strategic_tailor_v2` | 0.1 – 0.2 | Planning requires consistency |
| `headline_tailor_v1` | 0.25 – 0.45 | Some creativity for positioning |
| `executive_summary.generate_scratch_v1` | 0.35 – 0.55 | Natural language variation |
| `unify_bullet_tailor_v1` HEAVY | 0.35 – 0.50 | Rewrite variation |
| `unify_bullet_tailor_v1` MODERATE | 0.25 – 0.40 | Moderate variation |
| `unify_bullet_tailor_v1` LIGHT_PROTECTED | 0.05 – 0.15 | Minimal change |
| `unify_position_narrative_v1` | 0.35 – 0.55 | Natural phrasing |
| `ibm_bullet_tailor_v1` MODERATE | 0.20 – 0.35 | Conservative enterprise tone |
| `ibm_bullet_tailor_v1` LIGHT_PROTECTED | 0.05 – 0.15 | Minimal change |
| `ibm_position_narrative_v1` | 0.25 – 0.40 | Professional narrative |
| `competency_selector_v2` | 0.10 – 0.25 | Structured output |
| `final_unify_v2` | 0.0 – 0.1 | Consistency only |
| `resume_fact_check_v2` | 0.0 | Deterministic validation |
| `unsupported_claim_omission_v2` | 0.0 | Deterministic validation |
| `docx_manifest_v2` | — | Deterministic, no model |
| Locked copy assembler | — | Deterministic, no model |

### Temperature Calibration Method

For each model-backed lane:
1. Run sweep across allowed band using fixed fixtures: **low**, **midpoint**, **high**
2. Select the **highest temperature that passes all hard gates**
3. Store selected temperature in `lane_temperature_profile`
4. Reject failing high-temperature candidates

### Temperature Calibration Tests

- Each model-backed lane has explicit temperature profile
- Deterministic copy lanes have no temperature and no model call
- Validator lanes run at temperature 0.0
- Sweep selects highest passing temperature, not arbitrary midpoint
- High-temperature failing output is rejected
- Unsupported claim at high temperature fails calibration
- Role header mutation at high temperature fails calibration
- JD keyword stuffing at high temperature fails calibration
- Competency bullet-restatement at high temperature fails calibration
- Runtime receipt records model, provider, temperature, prompt hash, input hash, output hash, gate result

---

## 5. Section-Level Evaluation Metrics and Reporting

### Metric Philosophy

**One global apps_rg resume quality metric suite**, recorded at section and lane granularity.

**Rationale:**
- Different metric definitions per section create unnecessary complexity
- Cross-section comparison is harder with different definitions
- Core safety metrics are the same everywhere
- Section-specific behavior handled through threshold profiles, not different definitions

### Shared Global Metrics

| # | Metric | Definition |
|---|--------|------------|
| 1 | `unsupported_material_claim_count` | Claims without source_fact_id support |
| 2 | `unsupported_metric_count` | Numbers without source evidence |
| 3 | `source_fact_id_coverage_rate` | % of material claims with source |
| 4 | `copied_field_mutation_count` | Changes to company/location/title/dates |
| 5 | `locked_copy_mutation_count` | Changes to locked section content |
| 6 | `jd_phrase_copy_violation_count` | >4 consecutive JD words |
| 7 | `em_dash_count` | Em dash characters |
| 8 | `schema_violation_count` | Output schema non-compliance |
| 9 | `gap_capture_rate` | % of unsupported JD requirements captured |
| 10 | `claim_ledger_completeness_rate` | % of claims with ledger entries |
| 11 | `briefing_as_proof_violation_count` | Claims using briefing as evidence |
| 12 | `section_count_or_shape_violation_count` | Wrong bullet count, category count, etc. |
| 13 | `prompt_payload_scope_violation_count` | Wrong facts in prompt payload |
| 14 | `temperature_gate_pass` | Temperature within calibrated range |
| 15 | `final_fact_check_pass` | All fact checks pass |

### Metric Tracking Dimensions

Every metric tracked by:
- `run_id`, `lane_id`, `section_id`, `prompt_id`
- `model`, `provider`, `temperature`, `seed`
- `rewrite_intensity` (when applicable)
- `input_payload_hash`, `output_payload_hash`
- `claim_ledger_hash`, `base_section_hash`, `allowed_fact_ids_hash`
- `gate_result`

### Section-Specific Thresholds

Metric definitions are **global**. Thresholds and applicability vary by lane.

| Lane | Specific Thresholds |
|------|---------------------|
| **headline** | X \| Y \| Z format, 8-11 words, exactly 3 segments |
| **executive_summary** | `selected_fact_plan` required, 100% source coverage, 0 unsupported claims |
| **Unify bullets** | Exactly 6 bullets, valid rewrite distribution, metrics preserved |
| **Unify narrative** | Exactly 1 sentence, no metric repetition, no structure copy |
| **IBM bullets** | Exactly 5 bullets, 0 HEAVY, no forbidden terms |
| **IBM narrative** | Exactly 1 sentence, no Unify term import |
| **competencies** | Exactly 8 categories, all terms map to source_fact_ids, no bullet restatement |
| **locked copy** | `locked_copy_mutation_count` = 0, hash matches canonical JSON |
| **final_unify_v2** | `new_claim_count` = 0, `locked_copy_mutation_count` = 0 |

### Section Metric Receipt

    "total_schema_violations": 0,
    "total_jd_copy_violations": 0,
    "final_pass": true
  }
}
```

### Metric Tests Required

- Every LLM-generated lane emits a section metric receipt
- Locked copy lanes emit deterministic copy metrics, no model metrics
- Metric definitions are shared globally
- Threshold profiles can vary by section
- Unify metrics tracked separately from IBM metrics
- Narrative metrics tracked separately from bullet metrics
- Temperature calibration records metrics per lane
- Final aggregate metric receipt fails if any section has unsupported material claims
- Final aggregate metric receipt fails if any locked copied field changes
- Final aggregate metric receipt fails if any LLM-generated section is missing claim ledger metrics

## 12. Top 5 Highest-Risk Prompt Gaps

| Rank | Gap | Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----|------|------------|
| 1 | **Monolithic `strategic_tailor_v1`** — Generates full resume in one prompt, violating non-monolithic architecture | Resume integrity failures, untraceable claims, locked section mutation | W2: Create `strategic_tailor_v2` planning-only; W3: Implement section lanes |
| 2 | **No section-specific lanes** — Missing headline, bullet, narrative, competency separation | Cross-section contamination, repetition, metric inconsistencies | W2: Create 7 section-specific templates; W3: Wire L2 lanes |
| 3 | **No locked section enforcement** — InsurTech, EY, Early Career, Education, Certs not protected from LLM modification | Resume fraud, experience falsification | W4: Implement deterministic copy with byte-for-byte preservation |
| 4 | **No claim ledger output** — No structured evidence traceability | Unverifiable claims, no fact-checking possible | W5: Add claim_ledger to all generation prompts; W7: Implement v2 validators |
| 5 | **JD can become proof** — Oath present but no runtime verification of claim sources | JD mimicry, unsupported claims presented as experience | W5: Add claim tracing; W7: Strengthen fact check validators |

## 15. Next Steps

1. **Review this hardened plan** — Approve wave structure, W1 plan-only constraint, and no-core-edit rule
2. **W1 execution** — Define retirement strategy (NO existing YAML template edits)
3. **Wave-by-wave authorization** — Each wave requires explicit go-ahead and produces receipt artifact
4. **Test-first development** — Tests before runtime wiring for every template
5. **No agentic_core changes** — App-local bindings under `apps_rg/runtime/bindings/` only
6. **Monolith decommission gate** — CI gate active by W8 to block monolithic paths

---

## 16. Wave Receipt Requirements

Each wave (W1-W8) **MUST** produce a receipt artifact at:
```
artifacts/apps_rg/prompt_reset/<wave>_receipt.json
```

### Receipt Schema

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `wave_id` | string | Wave identifier (e.g., "W2A") |
| `receipt_timestamp` | ISO8601 | UTC timestamp of receipt generation |
| `files_changed` | list[string] | Relative paths of all files created/modified |
| `tests_run` | list[string] | Test files executed |
| `test_result` | PASS \| FAIL | Overall test result |
| `test_details` | object | Per-test pass/fail breakdown |
| `prompts_added` | list[string] | New prompt IDs added to registry |
| `prompts_retired` | list[string] | Prompt IDs marked for retirement |
| `runtime_routes_added` | list[string] | New L2 runtime routes |
| `runtime_routes_changed` | list[string] | Modified L2 runtime routes |
| `agentic_core_diff_empty` | boolean | Confirmation no agentic_core changes |
| `monolithic_path_status` | BLOCKED \| ACTIVE | Whether monolithic paths are blocked |
| `receipt_hash` | string | SHA256 of receipt content |
| `verification_signature` | string | Verification signature |

### W1 Receipt Special Requirements

W1 is **plan-only** — the W1 receipt MUST confirm:
- No existing YAML template files were edited
- No strategic_tailor_v1, tailor_existing_v1, generate_scratch_v1, enhance_current_v1, unify_v1 modifications
- Only plan documents and design specs were created

### Final W8 Receipt

The W8 receipt MUST confirm:
- All 40 test cases pass in 8 grouped test files
- Monolith decommission gate is active in CI
- No active runtime route points to strategic_tailor_v1 for generation
- `agentic_core/` diff is empty across entire reset

---

## 17. Monolith Decommission Gate (CI Enforcement)

### Gate Purpose

After reset completion, **CI MUST FAIL** if any runtime path invokes monolithic full-resume generation.

### Gate Implementation

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Gate Name** | `MONOLITH-DECOMMISSION` |
| **Gate Location** | `ops_scripts/ci/check_apps_rg_monolith_decommission.py` |
| **Trigger** | Every PR, every merge to main |
| **Severity** | FAIL (blocking) |
| **Bypass** | `MONOLITH_DECOMMISSION_BYPASS=1` (emergency only, logged) |

### Forbidden Patterns (Gate Detection)

The gate MUST detect and block:

| Pattern | Violation |
|---------|-----------|
| `strategic_tailor_v1` invoked for resume generation | Monolithic full-resume generation |
| `tailor_existing_v1` invoked for resume generation | Deprecated monolithic path |
| `generate_scratch_v1` invoked for resume generation | Deprecated monolithic path |
| `enhance_current_v1` invoked for resume generation | Deprecated monolithic path |
| `unify_v1` invoked as primary generation | Monolithic consistency pass |
| Any template with `allowed_stage: E3_EXEC` and `sections: [summary, experience, projects, skills, education]` in output contract | Monolithic full-resume template |

### Allowed Patterns

| Pattern | Permitted Use |
|---------|---------------|
| `strategic_tailor_v2` | Planning-only, NO resume prose |
| `headline_tailor_v1` | Single section (headline) |
| `executive_summary.generate_scratch_v1` | Single section (summary) |
| `unify_bullet_tailor_v1` | Single section (bullets only) |
| `unify_position_narrative_v1` | Single section (narrative only) |
| `resume_fact_check_v2` | Validation only |
| `unsupported_claim_omission_v2` | Validation only |
| `final unify_v2` | Consistency pass only |
| `docx_manifest_v2` | Render manifest only |

### Gate Output

```json
{
  "gate_id": "MONOLITH-DECOMMISSION",
  "result": "PASS|FAIL",
  "monolithic_paths_detected": [],
  "active_section_lanes_verified": [
    "strategic_tailor_v2",
    "headline_tailor_v1",
    "executive_summary.generate_scratch_v1",
    "unify_bullet_tailor_v1",
    "unify_position_narrative_v1",
    "ibm_bullet_tailor_v1",
    "ibm_position_narrative_v1",
    "competency_selector_v2"
  ],

}
```

## 18. W8 Test Grouping (8 Files, 40 Test Cases)

The 40 required test cases are grouped into 8 domain files:

| Test File | Test Cases | Coverage |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| `test_prompt_registry_reset.py` | 5 cases | Registry updates, retirement markers, v1→v2 transitions |
| `test_section_l2_routing.py` | 5 cases | Lane ordering, bullet→fact_check→narrative sequence, section isolation |
| `test_headline_summary_prompts.py` | 5 cases | Headline X\|Y\|Z format, word count, constraints; Summary evidence-first, no word count, claim_ledger |
| `test_unify_ibm_prompts.py` | 10 cases | Bullet counts (6/5), distributions, narrative 1-sentence, ordering, IBM term filtering |
| `test_locked_copy_contracts.py` | 5 cases | Byte-for-byte preservation for InsurTech, EY, Early Career, Education, Certs |
| `test_competency_selector.py` | 5 cases | 8 categories, format, JD exclusion, source mapping, anti-repetition |
| `test_final_validators_docx_manifest.py` | 5 cases | Claim ledger validation, omission report, DOCX locked section proof, final unify constraints |
| `test_no_core_leakage.py` | 5 cases | agentic_core diff empty, no shim edits, app-local binding isolation, monolith gate active |

### 15.1 Runtime Payload Tests (Critical Addition)

In addition to template content tests, the following runtime payload tests **MUST** prove section isolation:

| Test Case | Assertion | Failure Mode |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| `test_unify_payload_isolation` | Unify bullet prompt does NOT receive IBM facts as writable proof | Cross-contamination |
| `test_ibm_payload_isolation` | IBM bullet prompt does NOT receive Unify facts as writable proof | Cross-contamination |
| `test_competency_payload_scope` | Competency prompt receives finalized bullets ONLY as anti-repetition context | Scope violation |
| `test_locked_sections_not_in_model_payload` | Locked sections NEVER enter model prompt payload as writable text | Integrity violation |
| `test_section_scoped_allowed_fact_ids` | Each section prompt receives ONLY section-scoped allowed_fact_ids | Fact leakage |
| `test_final_unify_no_add_authority` | Final unify receives assembled sections and ledgers, but NO authority to add content | Authority violation |
| `test_docx_manifest_hash_validation` | DOCX manifest fails if locked source hash changes | Preservation failure |
| `test_base_resume_ssot_freeze` | base_resume_ssot_ref frozen at workflow start, carried through all packets | Drift risk |
| `test_old_master_resume_blocked` | Older master_resume.json cannot override current base resume DOCX | SSOT violation |
| `test_strategic_tailor_v2_planning_only` | strategic_tailor_v2 output contains NO resume prose, only planning artifacts | Monolith escape |

**Test Implementation:** These tests inspect actual L2 call payloads at runtime, not just YAML template content.
