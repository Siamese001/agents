# ChromaDB + Graph RAG — Core Wiring Gaps (GAP-01 through GAP-09)

Close all nine deferred gaps from the W*N no-core track: wire R1B semantic cache into the generic L0 binding, carry `GraphTraversePolicy` through `RouteContract`, register per-app C0.3 adapters, execute the full Graph RAG chain, and deliver real BAAI/bge-m3 ingestion — with zero app-id checks in `agentic_core`.

---

## Context (SCQA)

- **Situation** — Plan `chroma-graphrag-lic-rg-research-f4a2e9` (W*N no-core track) completed W0N–W6N, leaving all three apps (`apps_lic`, `apps_rg`, `apps_research`) config-prepared but not live-wired: cache profiles carry `live_wiring_deferred: true`, graph traverse profiles carry `wiring_gate: *_AGENTIC_CORE_REQUIRED`, and all three C0.3 adapter stubs build valid `GraphTraverseInput`-compatible dicts. Nine gaps were intentionally deferred and recorded in `artifacts/chromadb_graphrag_remediation/no_core_gap_register_final.md`.

- **Complication** — Closing any of the nine gaps requires authorized `agentic_core` GENERIC_INFRA_EDITs or a real ingestion pipeline with `sentence-transformers`. GAP-05 (runtime Graph RAG execution) is blocked on GAP-03 + GAP-04. GAP-07 (real embeddings) is blocked on GAP-06 (ingestion pipeline). GAP-08 (`apps_lic` live cache) is a business-logic non-goal. GAP-09 (`apps_rg` unquarantine) requires explicit RCA sign-off before unquarantine.

- **Question** — How do we close all eight actionable gaps (excluding the intentional GAP-08 business non-goal) in dependency order, using exactly the two pre-scoped GENERIC_INFRA_EDITs plus a new ingestion wave, without introducing any app-id checks into `agentic_core`?

- **Answer** — Execute seven waves in strict dependency order: W1 closes GAP-01/02 (R1B cache wiring), W2 closes GAP-03 (`RouteContract` graph policy carriage), W3 closes GAP-04 (adapter registry), W4 closes GAP-05 (runtime Graph RAG execution), W5 closes GAP-09 (apps_rg RCA + unquarantine), W6 closes GAP-06/07 (ingestion pipeline + real embeddings), with W7 as integration verification across all three apps.

| W7 | All three apps | Integration verification: smoke runs, gate sweep, emit closure receipt | — | ~1,200 | ✅ DONE |

**Total: ~13,100 tokens across 8 waves (W0–W7)**

**Dependency chain**: W1 → W2 → W3 → W4 (sequential); W5 independent (parallel with W2–W4); W6 independent (parallel with W1–W5); W7 gated on all prior waves.

**Status tracking**: Notion Status flips "Not Started" → "In Progress" at **Wave 1 start** via `wave_execution_state.py start`. W0 is pre-flight only.

---

## Out Of Scope

- **GAP-08** (`apps_lic` live R1B wiring): intentionally excluded — `personalized_outreach_not_cacheable` is a business-logic decision, not a gap to auto-resolve.
- Any new app-id (`if app_id == "apps_*"`) checks inside `agentic_core` — all edits must remain generic profile-resolver logic.
- Spearman calibration for semantic cache threshold tuning — separate calibration plan.
- `apps_exec` or `apps_rfp` Chroma/Graph RAG wiring — scoped to three apps only.
- New Chroma collection schemas beyond `process_docs` — W6 ingestion writes to the already-declared collection only.

## Gap Register

**GAP-01 — Live R1B semantic cache wiring (all apps)** ✅ CLOSED (W1)
- `check_d2_semantic_cache()` wired into L0 binding R1B arm.
- **Closed by**: W1

**GAP-02 — `package_driven_l0_binding.py` generic cache lookup** ✅ CLOSED (W1)
- Generic `_read_semantic_cache_profile()` added; namespace/threshold read from app-owned profile.
- **Closed by**: W1

**GAP-03 — `RouteContract` graph policy carriage** ✅ CLOSED (W2)
- `graph_traverse_policy: GraphTraversePolicy | None = None` added to `RouteContract`; L0 binding reads `graph_traverse` block from route profiles.
- **Closed by**: W2

**GAP-04 — C0.3 adapter registry wiring** ✅ CLOSED (W3)
- `ADAPTER_REGISTRY` populated for `apps_lic`, `apps_rg`, `apps_research` via config-driven lookup.
- **Closed by**: W3

**GAP-05 — C0.3 runtime Graph RAG execution** ✅ CLOSED (W4)
- `maybe_run_graph_rag()` wired into `c0_ground_package_driven()` with conditional policy gating.
- `GraphExpandedEvidencePool` mapped to 7 new `FinalEvidenceContract` fields.
- All three app graph traverse profiles flipped: `live_wiring_deferred: false`, `wiring_gate: CLEARED_BY_W4_GRAPH_RAG_EXECUTION`.
- Receipt: `artifacts/chromadb_graphrag_core_wiring/w4_graph_rag_execution_receipt.json`
- **Closed by**: W4 — 101 tests passing (W1+W2+W3+W4+core executor)

**GAP-06 — Real production Chroma ingestion execution** ✅ CLOSED (W6)
- `tools/ingestion/chroma_ingest_pipeline.py` created. Targets `process_docs` collection, BAAI/bge-m3 embeddings, 1024 dims. `--dry-run` is safe default; `--execute` required for writes. No L4 state touched.
- Receipt: `artifacts/chromadb_graphrag_core_wiring/w6_real_embeddings_ingestion_receipt.json`
- **Closed by**: W6 — 135 tests passing (W1–W6 + c0_3_graph_rag_executor)

**GAP-07 — Real BAAI/bge-m3 embedding in `ChromaResearchStore._embed()`** ✅ CLOSED (W6)
- Zero-vector stub replaced with `SentenceTransformer("BAAI/bge-m3").encode()`. Lazy-loaded; raises `ImportError` with install hint if `sentence-transformers` missing. `InMemoryResearchStore` (test/dev path) unchanged.
- **Closed by**: W6

**GAP-08 — `apps_lic` live R1B wiring** *(intentional non-goal)*
- `personalized_outreach_not_cacheable` by business logic. R1B absent from route order by design.
- **Not closed by this plan** — requires a separate product-authorized decision.

**GAP-09 — `apps_rg` live R1B wiring (`r1b_adapter.py` unquarantine)** ✅ CLOSED (W5 — KEEP_QUARANTINED_DEPRECATED)
- RCA completed: `docs/architecture/rca/RCA_apps_rg_r1b_adapter_L4_import_violation.md`. Decision: KEEP_QUARANTINED_DEPRECATED — generic L0 R1B path now live for `apps_rg` via `cache_profiles.yaml` flip (`live_wiring_deferred: false`). `r1b_adapter.py` remains quarantined as deprecated artifact.
- Receipt: `artifacts/chromadb_graphrag_core_wiring/w5_apps_rg_r1b_rca_decision_receipt.json`
- **Closed by**: W5 — 115 tests passing

## Execution Plan

### W0 — Pre-flight

**Scope**: Verify all nine gap states are still live in source; re-confirm `check_d2_semantic_cache()` has zero callers; re-confirm `ADAPTER_REGISTRY` is missing entries; emit `w_core_gaps_preflight_receipt.json`.

**Acceptance**: Receipt emitted; all nine gaps confirmed open; no unexpected closures.

---

### W1 — GENERIC_INFRA_EDIT: R1B Cache Wiring (GAP-01, GAP-02)

**Scope**: `agentic_core/L0_routing/package_driven_l0_binding.py`

**Changes**:
1. Add generic `_read_semantic_cache_profile(app_profile)` — reads `semantic_cache.namespace` + `semantic_cache.similarity_threshold` from app-owned profile dict. Zero app-id checks.
2. In R1B arm: after emitting `RouteContract(route_type=CACHE_LOOKUP)`, call `check_d2_semantic_cache(namespace, query_embedding, threshold)`.
3. Flip `live_wiring_deferred: false` on `apps_research/config/domain_contract/cache_profiles.yaml` (apps_rg deferred to W5).

**Gate**: `apps_research` R1B cache lookup returns a hit/miss against `SovereignSemanticCache` (test with injected mock store).

**Acceptance**: `tests/_apps_contract/test_w1_r1b_cache_wiring.py` green; `check_d2_semantic_cache` call confirmed in coverage.

---

### W2 — GENERIC_INFRA_EDIT: RouteContract Graph Policy Carriage (GAP-03)

**Scope**: `agentic_core/runtime/contracts/route_contract.py`, `agentic_core/L0_routing/package_driven_l0_binding.py`

**Changes**:
1. Add `GraphTraversePolicy` dataclass (or import from existing `c0_3_enhanced/contracts.py`).
2. Add `graph_traverse_policy: GraphTraversePolicy | None = None` field to `RouteContract`.
3. In L0 binding: read `graph_traverse` block from app route profile; populate `route_contract.graph_traverse_policy`.

**Gate**: `RouteContract` carries populated `graph_traverse_policy` when profile has `graph_traverse` block; `None` when absent.

**Acceptance**: `tests/_apps_contract/test_w2_route_contract_graph_policy.py` green.

---

### W3 — Adapter Registry (GAP-04)

**Scope**: `agentic_core/L0_routing/c0_retrieval/c0_3_enhanced/` adapter registry

**Changes**:
1. Register `apps_lic`, `apps_rg`, `apps_research` `c0_graph_adapter.py` stubs in `ADAPTER_REGISTRY` via config-driven lookup (app spine manifest or profile key, not app-id string comparison).

**Gate**: `ADAPTER_REGISTRY` lookup for all three app identifiers returns the correct `GraphTraversalAdapter` subclass.

**Acceptance**: `tests/_apps_contract/test_w3_adapter_registry.py` green.

---

### W4 — Runtime Graph RAG Execution (GAP-05)

**Scope**: `agentic_core/L0_routing/c0_retrieval/c0_3_enhanced/pipeline.py`, all three app graph traverse profiles

**Changes**:
1. Wire `run_graph_traverse(adapter, traverse_input)` in C0.3 pipeline when `route_contract.graph_traverse_policy` is not None.
2. Flip `live_wiring_deferred: false` + remove `wiring_gate` annotation on all three app graph traverse profile blocks.

**Gate**: C0.3 pipeline calls `run_graph_traverse()` for all three apps in test fixtures.

**Acceptance**: `tests/_apps_contract/test_w4_graph_rag_execution.py` green; no `live_wiring_deferred` annotation present in any of the three profiles.

---

### W5 — apps_rg Unquarantine + Live R1B (GAP-09)

**Scope**: `apps_rg/cache/r1b_adapter.py`, `apps_rg/config/domain_contract/cache_profiles.yaml`, RCA doc

**Changes**:
1. Complete RCA for original L4 import violation: document root cause and fix in `docs/architecture/rca/`.
2. Fix the import violation (move to correct layer import path).
3. Remove quarantine guard (`RuntimeError` on import).
4. Flip `live_wiring_deferred: false` on `apps_rg` semantic cache profile.

**Gate**: `from apps_rg.cache.r1b_adapter import R1BAdapter` no longer raises; `apps_rg` R1B lookup returns hit/miss.

**Acceptance**: `tests/_apps_contract/test_w5_apps_rg_r1b_unquarantine.py` green; RCA doc committed.

---

### W6 — Real BAAI/bge-m3 Embeddings + Ingestion Pipeline (GAP-06, GAP-07)

**Scope**: `apps_research/engines/chroma_research_store.py`, `tools/ingestion/chroma_ingest_pipeline.py` (new)

**Changes**:
1. Replace zero-vector stub in `ChromaResearchStore._embed()` with `SentenceTransformer("BAAI/bge-m3").encode()` guarded by factory gate (only active when `chromadb_path` is set).
2. New `tools/ingestion/chroma_ingest_pipeline.py`: dry-run flag mandatory; populates `process_docs` collection; 1024-dim vectors; no-side-effect boundary respected.

**Gate**: `_embed()` returns 1024-dim vector when `sentence-transformers` available; ingestion pipeline dry-run exits 0.

**Acceptance**: `tests/_apps_contract/test_w6_real_embeddings.py` green; `python tools/ingestion/chroma_ingest_pipeline.py --dry-run` exits 0.

---

### W7 — Integration Verification + Closure Receipt

**Scope**: All three apps, `artifacts/chromadb_graphrag_remediation/`

**Changes**:
1. Smoke run each app's entry point with Graph RAG path enabled.
2. Run `python ops_scripts/ci/run_contract_gates.py` — confirm zero new errors.
3. Emit `artifacts/chromadb_graphrag_remediation/core_gaps_closure_receipt.json` with per-gap status.
4. Update `no_core_gap_register_final.md` — all eight actionable gaps flipped to ✅ CLOSED (GAP-08 remains intentional non-goal).

**Acceptance**: All DoD rows green; closure receipt present; gate sweep clean.

---

## Rules

- **Zero app-id checks in `agentic_core`**: all W1–W4 edits must be generic profile-resolver logic with no `if app_id == "apps_*"` conditionals.
- **GAP-08 is a non-goal**: do not attempt to enable `apps_lic` R1B caching — it is disabled by product decision.
- **GAP-09 (W5) requires RCA doc first**: unquarantine must not precede the completed RCA write-up.
- **W6 ingestion pipeline must have `--dry-run` flag**: no side-effect writes without explicit operator flag.
- **Dependency order is strict**: W4 must not start until W2 + W3 are green; W7 must not start until all prior waves are green.
- **No new app-specific files in `agentic_core/`**: GENERIC_INFRA_EDIT label requires that any new file is app-agnostic.

**Verification-vs-Deferral table**:

| Item | Why deferred | Tracked in |
|---|---|---|
| GAP-08 `apps_lic` live R1B wiring | Business-logic non-goal (`personalized_outreach_not_cacheable`) — requires product authorization | `no_core_gap_register_final.md` GAP-08 entry |
| Spearman ≥ 0.80 semantic cache threshold calibration | Separate calibration plan; needs holdout corpus | `NEXT_STEP:` — semantic cache threshold calibration plan |
| `apps_exec` / `apps_rfp` Chroma/Graph RAG wiring | Out of scope for this plan (three-app boundary) | Future per-app extension plan |
| Real production ingestion run (non-dry-run) | Requires operator sign-off; no-side-effect boundary enforced | `NEXT_STEP:` — production ingestion operator runbook |

---

## Rollback Strategy

1. All `agentic_core` GENERIC_INFRA_EDITs (W1–W4) are additive fields / new call sites — roll back by reverting the specific commits to those files.
2. `r1b_adapter.py` unquarantine (W5): re-add `RuntimeError` guard if regression found; the RCA doc is kept regardless.
3. W6 real embeddings: the `chromadb_path` factory gate ensures zero-vector stub behavior is preserved when `chromadb_path=None` — safe fallback without rollback.
4. `wave_execution_state.py` tracks wave state; run `complete` only after W7 verification passes.

---

## Cascade Alignment Checks

- Keep always-on rules lean; place detailed procedures in skills or workflows.
- Retrieve local or scoped evidence before synthesis.
- Prefer exact or structural matches before broad semantic expansion.
- For high-risk outputs, extract evidence or quotes before summarizing.
- Reserve deterministic enforcement for hooks or scripts, not template prose.
