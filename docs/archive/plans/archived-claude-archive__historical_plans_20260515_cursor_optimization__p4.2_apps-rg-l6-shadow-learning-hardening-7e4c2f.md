# apps_rg L6 Shadow Learning Hardening

**Plan type**: platform_core_change + app_boundary_enforcement  
**Tier**: T3 — cross-layer, >5 files, architectural invariant enforcement  
**Precedent**: audit findings G1–G6 from apps_rg Exit/L6/UWG audit session 2026-05-13  
**Revision**: 2026-05-13 — G1 reclassified CRITICAL/BLOCKER; W2.P1 changed from deprecate to delete; W2 tests replaced; W3 canonical ExhaustBundle source fixed to `agentic_core/runtime/exhaust/`; W1 proposal semantics tightened to proposed_state_diff-only with X3C/UWG/L4 lifecycle.  
**W0 completed 2026-05-13** — `check_no_direct_semantic_cache_write.py` exits 1 on unmodified codebase; identifies `section_agentic_pipeline.py:72`; 1 XFAIL + 1 PASSED.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

The apps_rg runtime has six audit findings. G1 and G2 are CRITICAL/BLOCKER findings. G3 is a
representation/false-proof gap. G4–G6 are lower-priority migration, stub, and observability gaps.
This plan remediates all findings in priority order with CI enforcement that prevents regression.

### Finding Summary

| ID | Severity | Description |
|----|----------|-------------|
| G2 | **CRITICAL** | `section_agentic_pipeline.py` calls `write_section_to_semantic_cache()` directly — UWG bypassed |
| G1 | **CRITICAL / BLOCKER** | `apps_rg/runtime/l6_shadow_learning.py` is a duplicate app-local L6 runtime engine outside canonical core. Contains its own `RuntimeExhaustBundle`, `ProposalPacket`, and `L6ShadowLearningProducer` — each duplicating a canonical core type. Zero callers makes it dormant, not acceptable. Must be deleted. |
| G3 | Medium | Section pipeline labels step "L6 Observe" — is only `print()` + span label, not real L6 |
| G4 | Low | `build_apps_rg_l6_proposer()` intentionally raises `RuntimeError` — migration gate, no fallback |
| G5 | Low | `CompletedRunEvaluator._extract_entity_aliases()` hardcoded zeros — documented stub |
| G6 | Low | `_emit_section_span()` uses `print()` instead of real OTel bridge |

### Constraints (hard rules, non-negotiable)

- `agentic_core/` MUST NOT gain any apps_rg-specific literals, branches, or logic.
- No second L6 runtime engine. Canonical engine is `agentic_core/L6_learning/package_driven_l6_binding.py`.
- `apps_rg/` may own only: profile YAML/JSON, calibration refs, taxonomy/schema dataclasses.
- Section pipeline MUST NOT write semantic cache directly (ever). UWG is the only write-admission path.
- L6 MUST NOT rescue, mutate, or reroute the current run.
- L6 MUST NOT emit X3.
- L6 MUST NOT write L4 directly.
- No silent patching of prompts, rubrics, policy, cache, memory, index, benchmarks, judges, or provider config.

## 4. Wave Specifications

---

### W0 — Baseline Proof

**Objective**: Prove G2 is detectable by a CI gate *before* W1 lands. The gate runs, finds the
violation, and exits non-zero (advisory). This establishes a negative-control baseline that W1 will
flip to green.

**Files touched**:

- `ops_scripts/ci/check_no_direct_semantic_cache_write.py` *(new)*

**What the gate does**:

1. Walk the AST of every `*.py` under `apps_rg/runtime/` and `agentic_core/`.
2. Flag any `import` of `apps_rg.cache.r1b_semantic` (or `from apps_rg.cache.r1b_semantic import ...`) outside the allowed caller set.
3. Allowed callers: `apps_rg/cache/r1b_semantic.py` itself (definition), and any file whose path starts with `apps_rg/cache/` or `agentic_core/runtime/uwg/` (UWG admission surface only).
4. Any other import of `write_section_to_semantic_cache` = violation.
5. Exit 1 on violation; exit 0 when clean.
6. Bypass: `DIRECT_CACHE_WRITE_BYPASS=1`.
7. Report: `artifacts/ci/direct_semantic_cache_write.json`.

**Tests added**:

- `tests/governance/test_apps_rg_uwg_cache_write_sovereignty.py` — negative-control test:
  - `test_section_pipeline_currently_violates_gate()`: runs the gate against the UNFIXED codebase,
    asserts exit code is non-zero (proving the gate is not a no-op).
  - This test is marked `@pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True, reason="W0 baseline: violation expected until W1 lands")`.
  - W1.P3 will un-xfail it.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- Gate runs and exits 1 on the unmodified codebase.
- Gate identifies `apps_rg/runtime/section_agentic_pipeline.py` as the violating file.
- `xfail` test passes (failure confirmed as expected).

**Rollback note**: W0 adds a new gate file only. Removing `check_no_direct_semantic_cache_write.py`
fully reverts W0. No existing code is changed.

---

### W1 — Block Direct Semantic Cache Bypass

**Objective**: Remove the direct `write_section_to_semantic_cache()` call from the section
pipeline. Replace it with an inert `SectionCacheWriteProposal` that is placed on the
`ExitBindingResult` for future UWG admission. The section pipeline no longer writes anything
durable.

**Files touched**:

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `apps_rg/runtime/section_agentic_pipeline.py` | Remove `from apps_rg.cache.r1b_semantic import write_section_to_semantic_cache`; replace `_write_section_to_semantic_cache()` body with inert proposal builder; return `SectionCacheWriteProposal` not a cache key |
| `apps_rg/runtime/schemas/__init__.py` | Add `SectionCacheWriteProposal` dataclass (frozen, inert — fields: `section_id`, `cache_key`, `content_digest`, `metadata_ref`, `proposal_status="PENDING_UWG"`) |
| `apps_rg/runtime/bindings/exit_binding.py` | `ExitBindingResult` gains optional `cache_write_proposals: tuple[SectionCacheWriteProposal, ...]` field (default empty tuple); Exit binding does NOT write these — it merely surfaces them |
| `tests/governance/test_apps_rg_uwg_cache_write_sovereignty.py` | Remove `xfail`; add positive-control tests (see below) |

**What the section pipeline produces instead of a direct write**:

```python
# BEFORE (violation):
cache_key = _write_section_to_semantic_cache(section_spec, content, ctx)

# AFTER (inert proposed_state_diff evidence only):
cache_proposal = SectionCacheWriteProposal(
    section_id=section_spec.section_id,
    cache_key=_compute_cache_key(section_spec, content, ctx),
    content_digest=hashlib.sha256(content.encode()).hexdigest()[:32],
    metadata_ref=f"section://{section_spec.section_id}",
    proposal_status="PENDING_UWG",
    # proposed_state_diff evidence only — not a write request
)
ctx.cache_write_proposal = cache_proposal
```

`SectionCacheWriteProposal` is **proposed_state_diff evidence only**. It is NOT a write request.
The lifecycle is:

```
Section pipeline → SectionCacheWriteProposal (inert)
    ↓ surfaced on ExitBindingResult.cache_write_proposals
Exit binding → surfaces proposal; does NOT activate it
    ↓ Exit emits X3Disposition
X3C (future) → may produce CommitRequest candidate from proposal
    ↓
UWG → admits CommitRequest; issues UWG receipt
    ↓
L4/cache surface → persists after UWG receipt
```

Exit MUST NOT activate the proposal. Exit MUST NOT call `write_section_to_semantic_cache`.
X3C is the only surface that may produce a `CommitRequest` from a `SectionCacheWriteProposal`.
UWG is the only surface that may admit it. L4/cache surface is the only surface that may
persist it after UWG receipt. Nothing is written to `artifacts/apps_rg/semantic_cache/` at
runtime via this path.

**Tests added** (in `test_apps_rg_uwg_cache_write_sovereignty.py`, replacing xfail):

- `test_gate_clean_after_w1()`: runs `check_no_direct_semantic_cache_write` gate, asserts exit 0.
- `test_section_pipeline_produces_inert_proposal_not_cache_write()`: instantiates
  `execute_section_full_pipeline()` in dry-run mode; asserts `ctx.cache_write_proposal` is a
  `SectionCacheWriteProposal` with `proposal_status="PENDING_UWG"`.
- `test_semantic_cache_dir_not_written_during_section_pipeline()`: after pipeline execution,
  asserts `artifacts/apps_rg/semantic_cache/` was not mutated (directory either absent or
  unchanged from before the call).
- `test_cache_write_proposal_is_frozen()`: asserts `SectionCacheWriteProposal` is a frozen
  dataclass (immutable after construction).
- `test_r1b_semantic_not_imported_in_section_pipeline()`: AST-walks
  `section_agentic_pipeline.py`; asserts no `ImportFrom` node references `r1b_semantic`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- `check_no_direct_semantic_cache_write.py` exits 0 against the patched codebase.
- All 5 new governance tests pass.
- `execute_section_full_pipeline()` dry-run completes without writing any file under
  `artifacts/apps_rg/semantic_cache/`.
- `ExitBindingResult.cache_write_proposals` is a `tuple[SectionCacheWriteProposal, ...]`
  not a `list` (immutability signal).

**Rollback note**: Revert `section_agentic_pipeline.py` to its pre-W1 state and delete the
`SectionCacheWriteProposal` dataclass. The `ExitBindingResult` field is additive; removing it
is safe. No tests outside W1 depend on this field.

---

### W2 — Eliminate Duplicate L6 Runtime Surface (G1 — CRITICAL)

**Objective**: Permanently remove the duplicate L6 runtime engine in `apps_rg/runtime/`. The
module contains three canonical-type duplicates that create a shadow runtime path:

| Duplicate in `l6_shadow_learning.py` | Canonical location |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `RuntimeExhaustBundle` (dataclass) | `agentic_core/runtime/exhaust/runtime_exhaust_bundle.py` |
| `ProposalPacket` (dataclass) | `agentic_core/L6_learning/__init__.py` |
| `L6ShadowLearningProducer` (engine class) | `agentic_core/L6_learning/package_driven_l6_binding.py` |

Schema-only types (`SectionCompletedEvalRecord`, `AggregateCompletedEvalRecord`) already exist
in `apps_rg/runtime/schemas/__init__.py`. They do not move — they are already in the right place.

#### W2.P1 — Delete `apps_rg/runtime/l6_shadow_learning.py`

**Pre-deletion verification** (must complete before deletion):
1. Confirm zero importers of `l6_shadow_learning` in `apps_rg/runtime/` (already confirmed by
   audit — zero callers).
2. Confirm `SectionCompletedEvalRecord` and `AggregateCompletedEvalRecord` are already present
   in `apps_rg/runtime/schemas/__init__.py` (confirmed — both exist there).
3. Confirm no test file imports from `apps_rg.runtime.l6_shadow_learning`.

**Action**: Delete `apps_rg/runtime/l6_shadow_learning.py`.

If any test fixture is found to import from this module, move only that fixture's referenced
schema types to `apps_rg/runtime/schemas/__init__.py` (they may already be there) before
deletion. The engine classes (`L6ShadowLearningProducer`, `produce_l6_shadow_learning`,
`create_runtime_exhaust_bundle`) are NOT migrated — they are duplicate implementations with
no authorized callers and must be deleted with the file.

**Non-action**: The convenience function `produce_l6_shadow_learning` and factory
`create_runtime_exhaust_bundle` are NOT moved to any other apps_rg location. They conflict
with canonical core factories and have no migration path within apps_rg scope.

**Quarantine option** (if deletion is blocked by git history tooling): Move to
`archives/apps_rg/l6_shadow_learning_deleted_2026-05-13.py` with a tombstone header. The
`archives/` directory is gitignored from production imports (gate: `check_no_archives_imports.py`).
Prefer outright deletion.

#### W2.P2 — Fix Fake L6 Span Label (G3)

**File touched**: `apps_rg/runtime/section_agentic_pipeline.py`

**Change**: Rename `_emit_section_span` call sites from stage label `"Exit/L6"` → `"Exit_observe"`;
rename `[L6-SHADOW]` print prefix → `[SECTION-OBSERVE]`. Add docstring clarification to
`_emit_section_span`:
```
# NOTE: This is telemetry span emission only. It is NOT L6 learning.
# Real L6 (CompletedRunEvaluator → RCA → ProposalPacket) runs post-Exit
# via agentic_core.L6_learning.package_driven_l6_binding, not here.
```

#### W2.P3 — CI Gate: No apps_rg Runtime L6 Engine

**File**: `ops_scripts/ci/check_no_apps_rg_runtime_l6_engine.py` *(new)*

What it checks:
1. AST-scan all `*.py` under `apps_rg/runtime/` (excluding `schemas/` and `bindings/`
   exit_binding builder).
2. Flag any class definition whose name contains `L6`, `Shadow`, `ShadowLearning`,
   `Evaluator`, `Producer`, or `Binding` and lives in `apps_rg/runtime/` (not `agentic_core/`).
3. Flag any `from apps_rg.runtime import` or `import apps_rg.runtime` that resolves to a
   name containing `l6`, `shadow_learning`, `exhaust_bundle`.
4. Flag any re-definition of `RuntimeExhaustBundle` or `ProposalPacket` outside
   their canonical modules.
5. Exit 1 on violation. Bypass: `APPS_RG_L6_ENGINE_BYPASS=1`.

**Tests added** (`tests/governance/test_apps_rg_l6_surface_ownership.py` — new file):
- `test_no_apps_rg_runtime_l6_engine_module()`: asserts `apps_rg/runtime/l6_shadow_learning.py`
  does not exist on disk after W2.P1 deletion.
- `test_l6_shadow_learning_not_importable_from_runtime()`: attempts
  `import apps_rg.runtime.l6_shadow_learning`; asserts `ModuleNotFoundError` is raised.
- `test_apps_rg_l6_schema_only_surfaces_are_config_or_schemas()`: asserts that the only
  L6-named types importable from `apps_rg` are `SectionCompletedEvalRecord` and
  `AggregateCompletedEvalRecord` from `apps_rg.runtime.schemas`, and that neither
  `L6ShadowLearningProducer` nor `produce_l6_shadow_learning` is importable from any
  `apps_rg.*` path.
- `test_package_driven_l6_only_runtime_engine()`: imports
  `agentic_core.L6_learning.package_driven_l6_binding`; asserts `PackageDrivenL6Binding`
  exists; then confirms no other class in `agentic_core/L6_learning/` has `Binding` in its
  name (single runtime engine invariant).
- `test_no_fake_l6_label_in_section_pipeline()`: AST-walks `section_agentic_pipeline.py`;
  asserts no string literal `"L6"` appears inside an `_emit_section_span` argument list.
- `test_l6_label_not_used_as_substitute_for_contracts()`: asserts
  `apps_rg.runtime.section_agentic_pipeline` does not export `CompletedEvalRecord`,
  `RCAPacket`, or `RuntimeExhaustBundle`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- `apps_rg/runtime/l6_shadow_learning.py` does not exist.
- `import apps_rg.runtime.l6_shadow_learning` raises `ModuleNotFoundError`.
- No L6 engine class defined under `apps_rg/runtime/`.
- `check_no_apps_rg_runtime_l6_engine.py` exits 0.
- 6 new governance tests pass.
- No `"L6"` span label in `_emit_section_span` calls.

**Rollback note**: W2.P1 deletion is the highest-risk step. If a downstream test breaks,
restore from git (`git checkout HEAD apps_rg/runtime/l6_shadow_learning.py`) and add the
missing schema to `apps_rg/runtime/schemas/__init__.py` before re-attempting deletion.
W2.P2/P3 are purely additive and independently rollback-safe.

---

### W3 — RuntimeExhaustBundle Handoff Validation

**Objective**: Prove that Exit produces a well-formed `RuntimeExhaustBundle` that can be handed
to `PackageDrivenL6Binding.process_completed_run()` without core containing any apps_rg literals.
This is a contract validation wave — it adds a typed builder in `apps_rg/` that assembles the
bundle from Exit outputs, with no logic leaking into `agentic_core/`.

**Files touched**:

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `apps_rg/runtime/bindings/exit_binding.py` | Add `build_exhaust_bundle_from_exit(exit_result: ExitBindingResult) -> RuntimeExhaustBundle` — thin mapper to canonical factory |
| `apps_rg/runtime/schemas/__init__.py` | No change required — `RuntimeExhaustBundle` lives in `agentic_core/runtime/exhaust/runtime_exhaust_bundle.py` and is built through `build_runtime_exhaust_bundle` |
| `tests/governance/test_apps_rg_l6_handoff_contract.py` *(new)* | Contract tests (see below) |

**`build_exhaust_bundle_from_exit` spec**:

Canonical import: `from agentic_core.runtime.exhaust.runtime_exhaust_bundle import build_runtime_exhaust_bundle`

This is **not** a new function — it is a call to the existing core factory. The apps_rg exit
binding adds a thin wrapper that maps `ExitBindingResult` fields to the factory's keyword
arguments:

```python
def build_exhaust_bundle_from_exit(
    exit_result: ExitBindingResult,
    learning_profile_ref: str = "",
    meta_feedback_profile_ref: str = "",
) -> RuntimeExhaustBundle:
    """Map apps_rg ExitBindingResult to canonical RuntimeExhaustBundle.
    
    apps_rg owns this mapper. Core owns the bundle schema and factory.
    Called ONLY post-Exit (exit_disposition_ref is required by the factory).
    Raises ValueError if exit_disposition_ref is empty (factory guard).
    """
    from agentic_core.runtime.exhaust.runtime_exhaust_bundle import build_runtime_exhaust_bundle
    return build_runtime_exhaust_bundle(
        request_id=exit_result.disposition.request_id,
        run_id=exit_result.disposition.run_id,
        trace_root=exit_result.disposition.trace_id,
        gate_mesh_result_ref=exit_result.gate_mesh_digest or "",
        exit_disposition_ref=exit_result.disposition_digest,  # required — factory raises if empty
        sealed_result_ref=exit_result.sealed_digest_ref or "",
        learning_profile_ref=learning_profile_ref,
        meta_feedback_profile_ref=meta_feedback_profile_ref,
    )
```

The factory's `__post_init__` enforces `created_after_exit=True` and `current_run_closed=True`
at construction — this is the primary boundary guard. The wrapper does NOT use the deleted
`create_runtime_exhaust_bundle` from `l6_shadow_learning.py`.

Fields populated:
- `request_id` ← `exit_result.disposition.request_id`
- `run_id` ← `exit_result.disposition.run_id`
- `trace_root` ← `exit_result.disposition.trace_id`
- `gate_mesh_result_ref` ← `exit_result.gate_mesh_digest` (G24–G27 digest ref, not dict)
- `exit_disposition_ref` ← `exit_result.disposition_digest` (**required** — factory raises if empty)
- `sealed_result_ref` ← `exit_result.sealed_digest_ref`
- `learning_profile_ref`, `meta_feedback_profile_ref` ← profile ref strings from apps_rg L6 profile config
- All other fields default to empty/tuple — acknowledged as stubs for future wiring

**Tests added**:

- `test_build_exhaust_bundle_populates_required_fields()`: calls `build_exhaust_bundle_from_exit` with a
  synthetic `ExitBindingResult`; asserts `run_id`, `trace_root`, and `exit_disposition_ref` are
  non-empty strings.
- `test_exhaust_bundle_is_frozen()`: asserts `RuntimeExhaustBundle` is a frozen dataclass
  (raises `FrozenInstanceError` on attribute assignment).
- `test_exhaust_bundle_uses_canonical_factory()`: asserts `build_exhaust_bundle_from_exit`
  in `apps_rg/runtime/bindings/exit_binding.py` calls
  `agentic_core.runtime.exhaust.runtime_exhaust_bundle.build_runtime_exhaust_bundle` (not
  any apps_rg-local factory, not the deleted `create_runtime_exhaust_bundle`).
- `test_canonical_exhaust_bundle_raises_without_exit_ref()`: calls
  `build_runtime_exhaust_bundle` directly with empty `exit_disposition_ref`; asserts
  `ValueError` is raised (factory boundary guard).
- `test_canonical_exhaust_bundle_raises_if_not_after_exit()`: constructs
  `RuntimeExhaustBundle(created_after_exit=False, ...)` directly; asserts `ValueError`.
- `test_build_exhaust_bundle_contains_no_apps_rg_literals_in_core()`: reads source of
  `agentic_core/runtime/exhaust/runtime_exhaust_bundle.py`; asserts no string `"apps_rg"`
  appears outside comments.
- `test_exhaust_bundle_builder_only_in_apps_rg()`: asserts `build_exhaust_bundle_from_exit`
  is defined only under `apps_rg/`.
- `test_l6_runs_only_after_exit_boundary()`: reuses the AST sentinel from
  `test_apps_rg_l6_learning_loop.py` pattern — asserts `system_learning` and
  `package_driven_l6_binding` are not imported inside the `governed_run` `with` block in
  `apps_rg/__main__.py`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- `build_exhaust_bundle_from_exit` exists in `apps_rg/runtime/bindings/exit_binding.py`.
- Returns a `RuntimeExhaustBundle` with all required fields populated (stubs acknowledged).
- `agentic_core/runtime/exhaust/runtime_exhaust_bundle.py` contains no `"apps_rg"` string in
  executable lines.
- 5 new tests pass.

**Rollback note**: `build_exhaust_bundle_from_exit` is a new export appended to `exit_binding.py`. Removing
it is fully safe — no existing callers. W3 tests are independent.

### W4 — G29 Learning Firewall + ObserverLaw Hardening

**Objective**: Establish a named gate identifier `G29` (Learning Firewall) that must be satisfied
before any `FutureRunPromotionRequest` proceeds. Prove all 7 ObserverLaw prohibitions are checked.

#### W4.P1 — G29 LearningFirewall Gate

G29 does not yet exist as a named constant. This wave introduces it.

**Files touched**:

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `agentic_core/L6_learning/promotion_gauntlet.py` | Add `GATE_ID = "G29"` class constant to `PromotionGauntlet`; add `gate_id: str = "G29"` to `L6GauntletResult` (already in `__init__.py`); emit `gate_id` in result |
| `agentic_core/L6_learning/__init__.py` | Add `gate_id: str = ""` field to `L6GauntletResult` |
| `ops_scripts/ci/check_g29_firewall.py` *(new)* | CI gate (see spec below) |
| `apps_rg/config/domain_contract/l6_learning_profile.json` *(new if absent)* | Profile asserting `g29_required: true` |

**`check_g29_firewall.py` spec**:

1. AST-scan `agentic_core/L6_learning/` and all callers of `run_gauntlet` or
   `validate_promotion` across the repo.
2. Assert every callsite that constructs a `FutureRunPromotionRequest` either:
   a. Passes through `PromotionGauntlet.run_gauntlet()`, OR
   b. Is a test with explicit `@pytest.mark.skip` + reason.
3. Assert `PromotionGauntlet.GATE_ID == "G29"` (import check).
4. Assert no code path exists where `uwg_review_status="APPROVED"` is set before gauntlet runs
   (static: grep for `uwg_review_status="APPROVED"` outside `universal_write_gate.py`).
5. Exit 0 = all clean. Exit 1 = violation. Bypass: `G29_FIREWALL_BYPASS=1`.

**Tests added** (`tests/runtime/test_l6_learning_firewall.py` — extend existing file):

- `test_g29_gate_id_is_canonical()`: asserts `PromotionGauntlet.GATE_ID == "G29"`.
- `test_g29_result_carries_gate_id()`: runs `PromotionGauntlet().run_gauntlet(...)` with a valid
  request; asserts `result.gate_id == "G29"`.
- `test_no_promotion_without_gauntlet()`: constructs a `FutureRunPromotionRequest` with
  `uwg_review_status="PENDING"` and asserts it cannot be passed to a hypothetical activator
  without gauntlet pass (structural: asserts `gauntlet_result.passed` is checked before any
  `uwg_review_status` mutation).

#### W4.P2 — ObserverLaw 7-Prohibition Tests

**File touched**: `tests/runtime/test_l6_observer_law_prohibitions.py` *(new)*

**Tests** (one per prohibition — parameterized for brevity):

```python
PROHIBITIONS = [
    ("x3_emitted",                   "no_x3_emission"),
    ("cache_write_attempted",        "no_cache_write"),
    ("vector_store_write_attempted", "no_vector_store_write"),
    ("l4_write_attempted",           "no_l4_write"),
    ("current_run_reroute_attempted","no_reroute_attempt"),
    ("current_run_reexecute_attempted","no_reexecute_attempt"),
    ("mutation_attempted",           "no_current_run_mutation"),
]
```

- `test_observer_law_blocks_each_prohibition(violation_key, receipt_field)`: constructs
  `ObserverLawValidator`; passes `l6_outputs` with `violation_key=True`; asserts `receipt_field`
  on returned `ObserverLawReceipt` is `False` and `evidence_refs` is non-empty.
- `test_observer_law_clean_run_all_true()`: passes all-False `l6_outputs`; asserts every
  assertion field is `True` and `evidence_refs` is empty.
- `test_observer_law_receipt_is_frozen()`: asserts `ObserverLawReceipt` is frozen.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- `PromotionGauntlet.GATE_ID == "G29"`.
- `L6GauntletResult.gate_id` populated on all gauntlet runs.
- All 7 ObserverLaw prohibition tests pass.
- `check_g29_firewall.py` exits 0 on the W4-patched codebase.

**Rollback note**: Adding `GATE_ID` and `gate_id` fields are additive. Removing them is safe.
`check_g29_firewall.py` can be deleted. All tests are new files.

### W5 — Promotion / UWG Proof

**Objective**: Harden `FutureRunPromotionRequest` to require all proof fields for mission-critical
promotion types; prove no proposal can activate without gauntlet → UWG → future-run-start chain.

#### W5.P1 — FutureRunPromotionRequest Proof Field Hardening

Current `FutureRunPromotionRequest` has `replay_proof_ref`, `regression_proof_ref`,
`safety_proof_ref`, `calibration_proof_ref` — all default `""`. The gauntlet already checks
these at run-time. This wave adds three missing fields:

**File touched**: `agentic_core/L6_learning/__init__.py`

**Changes to `FutureRunPromotionRequest`**:

```python
# New fields (all default ""):
completed_eval_record_ref: str = ""    # ref to CompletedEvalRecord evidence
rca_packet_ref: str = ""               # ref to RCAPacket
audit_manifest_ref: str = ""           # signed audit manifest ref (for Fort Knox path)
```

Add corresponding gauntlet checks in `PromotionGauntlet.run_gauntlet()`:

```python
# Check 7: completed_eval_record_ref required
if not promotion_request.completed_eval_record_ref:
    failures.append("COMPLETED_EVAL_RECORD_REQUIRED: Missing eval record ref")

# Check 8: rca_packet_ref required
if not promotion_request.rca_packet_ref:
    failures.append("RCA_PACKET_REQUIRED: Missing RCA packet ref")
```

`audit_manifest_ref` is advisory (warning, not failure) until Fort Knox proof path is wired.

**File touched**: `agentic_core/L6_learning/promotion_gauntlet.py`

#### W5.P2 — Promotion UWG Admission Test

**File touched**: `tests/governance/test_l6_promotion_uwg_required.py` *(new)*

**Tests**:

- `test_promotion_requires_eval_record_ref()`: builds `FutureRunPromotionRequest` with empty
  `completed_eval_record_ref`; runs gauntlet; asserts `passed=False` and failures contain
  `"COMPLETED_EVAL_RECORD_REQUIRED"`.
- `test_promotion_requires_rca_packet_ref()`: same for `rca_packet_ref`.
- `test_promotion_with_all_refs_passes_gauntlet()`: builds well-formed request with all refs
  populated; runs gauntlet; asserts `passed=True`.
- `test_no_auto_activate_ever()`: asserts `auto_activate=False` is the only allowed default;
  asserts gauntlet fails immediately when `auto_activate=True`.
- `test_uwg_review_status_pending_required()`: asserts gauntlet fails when
  `uwg_review_status="PRE_APPROVED"`.
- `test_activation_only_future_run()`: asserts gauntlet fails when
  `target_future_run_window="CURRENT_RUN"`.
- `test_proposal_inert_until_uwg()`: constructs `ProposalPacket` with `safety_review_status=
  "PENDING_UWG"`; asserts `is_inert() is True`; asserts `is_inert()` returns `False` only when
  `safety_review_status="ACTIVATED"`.
- `test_cache_memory_prompt_policy_rubric_require_uwg()`: for each `ProposalType` that touches
  a durable surface (`CACHE_THRESHOLD`, `PROMPT_IMPROVEMENT`, `RUBRIC_IMPROVEMENT`,
  `RETRIEVAL_PROFILE`, `CHUNKING_PROFILE`, `FRESHNESS_TTL`), asserts the corresponding
  `ProposalPacket` has `safety_review_status="PENDING_UWG"` and `activation_trigger=
  "FUTURE_RUN_START"` on construction.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- `FutureRunPromotionRequest` has `completed_eval_record_ref`, `rca_packet_ref`,
  `audit_manifest_ref` fields.
- Gauntlet fails when either ref is absent (checks 7+8 added).
- 8 new tests pass.

**Rollback note**: `FutureRunPromotionRequest` field additions are additive (default `""`).
Removing the two new gauntlet checks loosens the gate — acceptable rollback. All tests are new.

### W6 — CI / 99-Proof Closeout

**Objective**: Register all 10 new CI gates; run DoD smoke-run; confirm zero regressions; update
plan status and memory.

#### W6.P1 — Register All 10 CI Gates

**File touched**: `ops_scripts/ci/run_contract_gates.py`

Gates to register (in order, after existing L6/AEH gates):

| Gate ID | File | Description | Fail-closed env var |
|---------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| `L6-W1` | `check_no_direct_semantic_cache_write.py` | No direct cache write outside UWG | `DIRECT_CACHE_WRITE_FAIL_CLOSED=1` |
| `L6-W2a` | `check_no_fake_l6_span_label.py` *(new, small)* | No "L6" span label used as learning substitute | `FAKE_L6_SPAN_FAIL_CLOSED=1` |
| `L6-W2b` | `check_package_driven_l6_only.py` *(new)* | Only `package_driven_l6_binding` is a runtime L6 engine | `PACKAGE_DRIVEN_L6_ONLY_FAIL_CLOSED=1` |
| `L6-W2c` | `check_apps_rg_l6_profile_only.py` *(new)* | `apps_rg/` imports no `agentic_core.L6_learning` runtime class except via profile resolver | `APPS_RG_L6_PROFILE_ONLY_FAIL_CLOSED=1` |
| `L6-W3` | *(no separate gate — covered by W1+W3 tests)* | — | — |
| `L6-W4a` | `check_g29_firewall.py` | G29 required before promotion | `G29_FIREWALL_FAIL_CLOSED=1` |
| `L6-W4b` | `check_no_l6_current_run_mutation.py` *(new)* | Static: no L6 code path mutates current run | `L6_MUTATION_FAIL_CLOSED=1` |
| `L6-W4c` | `check_no_l6_x3_emit.py` *(new)* | Static: L6 never calls X3 emit path | `L6_X3_EMIT_FAIL_CLOSED=1` |
| `L6-W4d` | `check_no_l6_direct_l4_write.py` *(new)* | Static: L6 never calls L4 write path directly | `L6_L4_WRITE_FAIL_CLOSED=1` |

**Notes on new small gate files**:

- `check_no_fake_l6_span_label.py`: AST-scan `apps_rg/runtime/section_agentic_pipeline.py`;
  assert no call to `_emit_section_span` passes a stage string containing `"L6"`.
- `check_package_driven_l6_only.py`: grep `agentic_core/L6_learning/` for class definitions
  ending in `Binding` or `Engine`; assert only `PackageDrivenL6Binding` exists as a runtime
  binding class.
- `check_apps_rg_l6_profile_only.py`: AST-scan all `apps_rg/` Python files; assert no
  `ImportFrom` imports `CompletedRunEvaluator`, `RCASynthesizer`, `FutureRunProposalBuilder`,
  or `PromotionGauntlet` directly (these are core-owned; apps_rg accesses L6 only through
  profile config, not by importing core engine classes).
- `check_no_l6_current_run_mutation.py`: AST-scan `agentic_core/L6_learning/`; assert no
  function in that package accepts or returns `X3Disposition` as a non-read-only type, and no
  write to `current_run_*` attributes.
- `check_no_l6_x3_emit.py`: grep `agentic_core/L6_learning/` for `emit_x3`, `X3Disposition(`,
  or `exit_status=`; assert zero matches.
- `check_no_l6_direct_l4_write.py`: grep `agentic_core/L6_learning/` for `L4`, `l4_write`,
  `state_write`; assert zero matches outside comments.

All gates: advisory by default, fail-closed via env var, bypass via `*_BYPASS=1`.

#### W6.P2 — DoD Smoke Run

Run `python -m apps_rg --dry-run` with `APPS_RG_L2_FORCE_STUB=1`. Confirm:
1. Exit code 0.
2. No file written under `artifacts/apps_rg/semantic_cache/`.
3. `07_Exit_disposition.json` present in run dir.
4. No import of `write_section_to_semantic_cache` traceable from the section pipeline path.

#### W6.P3 — Plan Closeout

- Update plan status to Completed in Notion.
- Write memory entity `apps-rg-l6-hardening-7e4c2f` with wave summary, gap closures, and
  key invariants (G29=`PromotionGauntlet.GATE_ID`, UWG=only write path, apps_rg L6 = profile
  config only).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- All 10 gates registered in `run_contract_gates.py`.
- All gates exit 0 on the W1–W5 patched codebase (or advisory WARN — no ERROR).
- `python -m apps_rg --dry-run` exits 0 with no semantic cache write.
- Memory writeback complete.

**Rollback note**: Removing gate registrations from `run_contract_gates.py` is safe. Gate files
are new additions.

## 6. Definition of Done

| # | Criterion | Verification |
|---|-----------|--------------|
| DoD-1 | `check_no_direct_semantic_cache_write.py` exits 0 on final codebase | `python ops_scripts/ci/check_no_direct_semantic_cache_write.py` → exit 0 |
| DoD-2 | Section pipeline dry-run writes zero files under `artifacts/apps_rg/semantic_cache/` | `python -m apps_rg --dry-run ...` + directory absence check |
| DoD-3 | `SectionCacheWriteProposal.proposal_status == "PENDING_UWG"` on construction | Unit test `test_section_pipeline_produces_inert_proposal_not_cache_write` passes |
| DoD-4 | `PromotionGauntlet.GATE_ID == "G29"` | `test_g29_gate_id_is_canonical` passes |
| DoD-5 | All 7 ObserverLaw prohibitions individually tested | `test_l6_observer_law_prohibitions.py` 9-test sweep passes |
| DoD-6 | `apps_rg/runtime/l6_shadow_learning.py` does not exist on disk | `test_no_apps_rg_runtime_l6_engine_module` passes; `check_no_apps_rg_runtime_l6_engine.py` exits 0 |
| DoD-7 | No `"apps_rg"` string in executable lines of `agentic_core/L6_learning/` | `test_build_exhaust_bundle_contains_no_apps_rg_literals_in_core` passes |
| DoD-8 | All 10 CI gates registered in `run_contract_gates.py` and exit 0 (or advisory WARN) | `python ops_scripts/ci/run_contract_gates.py` no ERROR |
| DoD-9 | `FutureRunPromotionRequest` has `completed_eval_record_ref`, `rca_packet_ref`, `audit_manifest_ref` | `test_promotion_requires_eval_record_ref` + `test_promotion_requires_rca_packet_ref` pass |

### Verification-vs-Deferral

| Item | Decision |
|------|----------|
| Real `PackageDrivenL6Binding` wiring into apps_rg dispatch | Deferred — W3 validates the contract, not the live wiring. Full wiring is a separate plan. |
| X3C CommitRequest production from `SectionCacheWriteProposal` | Deferred — X3C surface not yet wired. W1 stops at surfacing the inert proposal on `ExitBindingResult`. |
| Fort Knox `audit_manifest_ref` enforcement (check 9 in gauntlet) | Deferred — advisory warning in W5, strict enforcement in Fort Knox phase |
| `_extract_entity_aliases` stub implementation (G5) | Deferred — documented stub, not blocking readiness receipts |
| Real OTel bridge in `_emit_section_span` (G6) | Deferred — print→bridge migration is a telemetry plan concern |
| `build_apps_rg_l6_proposer()` RuntimeError migration (G4) | No action — intentional migration gate, covered by existing RuntimeError |

---

## 7. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Removing `write_section_to_semantic_cache` call breaks downstream tests that assert cache exists | W0 gate will surface these tests; W1 uses dry-run mode for validation |
| `agentic_core/L6_learning/__init__.py` field addition breaks existing `FutureRunPromotionRequest` construction sites | All new fields default `""` — no existing construction site breaks |
| G29 gauntlet checks 7+8 cause existing test fixtures to fail | All existing gauntlet test fixtures pass empty refs → will now fail; W5 updates them |
| Section pipeline `SectionAgenticContext` field addition (`cache_write_proposal`) collides with future W5+ work | Field is additive on a dataclass; W5 does not touch `SectionAgenticContext` |

---

## 8. Non-Goals

- Implementing real L6 learning signal extraction (G5 stub remains).
- Wiring `PackageDrivenL6Binding` into the live dispatch call path (future plan).
- Adding `apps_rg`-specific logic to `agentic_core/`.
- Migrating `system_learning/runtime_hitl_consumer.py` (separate governance surface).
- Changing Fort Knox certification or runtime certification phases.
