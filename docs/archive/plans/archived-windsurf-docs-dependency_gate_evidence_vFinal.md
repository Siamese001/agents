# Dependency Audit — Full Execution Log (vFinal)

## SSOT Status

**Canonical Final Environment**

- Windows
- Python 3.12.10
- pip 26.0.1
- Clean venv: `.venv_verify`

All FINAL gate results in this document originate from `.venv_verify`.

Any references to:
- `.venv_gate`
- `.venv_final`
- `.venv_lean`
- pip 25.x
- core=13

are explicitly marked HISTORICAL and are non-authoritative.

# PHASE 4 — CANONICAL REGENERATION (.venv_verify)

---

## Gate A — pip Version

```text
> .venv_verify\Scripts\python.exe -m pip -V
pip 26.0.1 from C:\Git\Agentic-Workflow\.venv_verify\Lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.12)
```

Exit code: 0

---

## Gate B — Lean Core Install

```text
> .venv_verify\Scripts\pip.exe install -e .

Successfully installed 46 packages
```

Exit code: 0

---

## Gate C — Baseline Import Surface

```text
> .venv_verify\Scripts\python.exe -c "import agentic_core; import apps_shared; print('Gate C PASS')"
Gate C PASS
```

Exit code: 0

## Gate D — Verifier (Default: core required)

# HISTORICAL SECTIONS (Retained for Traceability Only)

---

## HISTORICAL — .venv_final (Obsolete)

> This environment predates final SSOT reconciliation.
> Uses pip 25.x and earlier core counts.
> Not authoritative.

Legacy output retained for audit trail only.

---

## HISTORICAL — .venv_lean (Supporting Only)

> Used to validate guardrail non-fire behavior.
> Not a canonical final environment.

```text
> .venv_lean\Scripts\pytest.exe tests/core/test_baseline_import_no_guardrail_fire.py
4 passed
```

Exit code: 0

# Verifier Semantics Confirmation

- `core` required in all modes
- `dev` required under `--require-dev` or `--all`
- `infra` required under `--require-infra` or `--all`
- `external` NEVER blocking
- `sdks` NEVER blocking

Invariant:

> external and sdks buckets are informational only and must never cause non-zero exit.

---

# Final Canonical State

- core = 15
- dev = 6
- infra = 15
- external = informational only
- sdks = informational only
- pip = 26.0.1
- Environment = `.venv_verify`
- All gates exit 0

---

# Final Status
