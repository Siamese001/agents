## Summary
Phase 1 of the hardened L5→L2 signaling plan has been successfully implemented and committed. The boundary enforcement mechanism is now operational with fail-closed L5 certification verification at L2 initialization.

## Implementation Details

### 1. InstructionPacket Extension
**File**: `agentic_core/L2_execution/types/instruction_packet_types.py`

- Added L5 certification fields:
  - `l5_signature`: HMAC-SHA256 signature from L5 guardian
  - `certification_timestamp`: ISO format UTC timestamp
  - `expiration_timestamp`: ISO format UTC expiration time
  - `agent_registry_hash`: SHA256 of agent registry
  - `execution_profile_hash`: SHA256 of execution profile
  - `policy_hash`: SHA256 of policy configuration

- Added `certify_l5()` method:
  - Creates new InstructionPacket with L5 certification
  - Uses L5-specific signing surface (excludes l5_signature field)
  - Computes both base and L5 signatures in correct order

- Added `verify_l5_certification()` method:
  - Verifies L5 signature using L5-specific signing surface
  - Validates expiration timestamp
  - Raises SignatureVerificationError on failures

- Added `is_l5_certified` property
- Added `_l5_signable_dict()` and `_base_signable_dict()` methods

### 2. L2 Boundary Verifier Enhancement
**File**: `agentic_core/L2_execution/enforcement/boundary_verifier.py`

- Enhanced constructor to accept optional L5 secret
- Added `verify_l5_certification()` method
- Added `verify_instruction_packet_with_l5()` method for dual verification
- Added validation methods: `is_l5_certified()`, `is_packet_valid_with_l5()`
- Updated docstrings with Phase 2 information

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite
**File**: `tests/agentic_core/L2_execution/types/test_l5_certification.py`

- 13 comprehensive tests covering:
  - L5 certification creation and verification
  - Signature verification with wrong secrets
  - Expiration enforcement
  - Missing field validation
  - Boundary verifier acceptance/rejection
  - Tamper detection
  - Determinism validation
  - Negative control tests
  - End-to-end flow validation

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Fail-Closed Boundary Enforcement
- L2 boundary verifier rejects uncertified packets
- No execution without valid L5 certification
- Cryptographic signature verification using HMAC-SHA256

### ✅ Deterministic Signing Surface
- Canonical JSON serialization with alphabetical keys
- Separate signing surfaces for base and L5 signatures
- No circular dependencies in signature computation

### ✅ Expiration Handling
- Configurable expiration time (default )
- Proper ISO format timestamp handling
- Expired certifications rejected

### ✅ Tamper Detection
- Any modification to L5 fields invalidates signatures
- Constant-time signature comparison
- Clear error messages for different failure modes

### ✅ Layer Sovereignty
- L5 certification is separate from base signature
- L5 verification uses distinct secret key
- Maintains existing base signature compatibility

## Test Results
```
13 passed in 0.05s
```

All tests are passing, including:
- Basic certification flow
- Signature verification
- Boundary enforcement
- Error handling
- Determinism
- Negative controls

## Cryptographic Details

### Signature Algorithm
- HMAC-SHA256 for both base and L5 signatures
- 64-character lowercase hex output
- Cryptographically secure key separation

### Canonicalization
- JSON with alphabetical key ordering
- No whitespace in output
- UTF-8 encoding for byte representation

### Key Management
- Base signature: Uses injected key source (TestKeySource in tests)
- L5 signature: Separate secret key provided to verifier
- No ambient secrets - explicit injection required

## Next Steps

Phase 1 is complete. The remaining phases from the hardened plan include:

### Phase 2: SovereignLLMGateway Integration
- Integrate with agent registry validation
- Add execution profile enforcement
- Implement gateway-only model resolution

### Phase 3: CI Enforcement
- Add CI guardrails for unsigned packet detection
- Implement contract validation in pipelines
- Add automated boundary enforcement testing

### Phase 4: Escalation Path
- Implement deterministic L2→L5 escalation
- Add FailureSignal routing through L0
- Create EscalationContext handling

### Phase 5: Permission Revocation
- Define sandbox permission semantics
- Implement safe revocation mechanisms
- Add permission lifecycle management
