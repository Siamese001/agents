# apps_qna Spine Alignment — Zero-Loss Refactor to Canonical agentic_core

Refactor apps_qna from a legacy static card builder to a governed, evidence-backed, two-tier live interview runtime card pack generator aligned with the canonical agentic_core spine.

---

## Context (SCQA)

**Situation** — apps_qna currently operates as a standalone static card builder with a legacy execution path. The `__main__.py` imports `run_qna` from `apps_qna.scripts` and directly instantiates `CardPackBuilder`. The spine_manifest.yaml claims only `build_time_compiler` route, which legitimately requires zero canonical authority contracts. While some spine integration exists (spine_handoff.py, spine_adapter.py), apps_qna does not participate in the full agentic_core spine for live interview runtime pack generation. The app lacks C0 grounding integration, two-tier card architecture, proper L2 E1-E5 execution receipts, and Exit v6/X3 control flow.

**Complication** — apps_qna needs to support live interview runtime mode where interviewer/company/person personalization is required. The current architecture cannot: (a) route deterministically through L0/L1, (b) call canonical C0 when grounding is required, (c) validate uploaded sealed briefing packets, (d) assemble domain card context from verified evidence, (e) render two-tier packs through L2 E1-E5, (f) seal artifacts properly, or (g) emit governed Exit dispositions. The existing static build path also has impure entrypoint, legacy direct execution, and lacks proper FEC/Exit integration.

**Question** — How do we refactor apps_qna to align with the canonical agentic_core spine while preserving existing static build functionality (either via compatibility shim or explicit deprecation), and prevent the same wiring failures identified across apps_lic, apps_rg, and apps_research?

**Answer** — Execute a zero-loss refactor through P0 (entrypoint purity + governance tests), W0 (thin-slice spine proof), and waves W1-W6 covering route model, C0 adapter, two-tier router, L2 E1-E5 render, Exit v6, and acceptance sweep. The outcome is apps_qna as a domain overlay that validates requests, plans evidence, routes deterministically, uses canonical C0 when grounding is required, validates uploaded briefings, assembles domain card context, renders two-tier packs through L2, seals artifacts, sends output to Exit, and lets L6 learn only after the run completes.

## Out Of Scope

The following are explicitly NOT part of this plan:

- Real LLM-judge implementations (stubs acceptable per deferred scope from apps-eval-harness-parity-f8d4a2)
- Production-log mining with PII redaction (deferred to future plan)
- Holdout vs dev eval-set separation (deferred)
- Per-app rubric migrations to new grader types (opt-in; schema ready per apps-eval-harness-deferred-e4a1b7)
- SSOT consolidation of legacy policy/threshold YAMLs (deferred)
- Canonical Prompt Assembly implementation (apps_qna does not call model at build time; domain card context assembly only)
- apps_rg/apps_lic/apps_research/app_underwriting_ai changes (each has their own plans)
- UWG/L4 durable write implementation for default path (local filesystem output is default; UWG only for approved future-run state)
- C0 retrieval wiring (C0 adapter calls canonical C0; retrieval implementation is separate)
- Provider SDK integration (apps_qna does not call providers directly)

## Gap Register

**GAP-1: __main__.py impure entrypoint**
- apps_qna/__main__.py imports and calls `run_qna` from `apps_qna.scripts`
- Directly instantiates `CardPackBuilder` in legacy path
- Imports builder, C0 adapter (planned), L2 stages (planned) would violate purity
- Impact: Cannot participate in canonical spine route/capability resolution

**GAP-2: No canonical capability registry**
- apps_qna lacks `register_live_interview_pack_capability()`
- No `resolve_live_interview_pack_capability(app_name, route_id)`
- No L2 step adapters registered for qna domain
- Impact: L0 cannot resolve apps_qna capabilities

**GAP-3: No C0 adapter boundary**
- apps_qna has no `c0_adapter.py` module
- No call to canonical agentic_core C0 for grounding
- No preservation of C0 evidence refs, source refs, support status
- Impact: Grounding_required=true path cannot satisfy evidence requirements

**GAP-4: No uploaded briefing validator**
- apps_qna has no `briefing_validator.py`
- No `UploadedBriefingEvidenceContract` type
- No validation of sealed briefing packets
- Impact: Cannot bypass C0 when valid briefing provided

**GAP-5: No two-tier card architecture**
- Current templates are single-tier (22 cards)
- No Tier 1 always-on / Tier 2 specialist split
- No compact target overlay separate from raw briefing
- Impact: Cards overfire; no routing precedence; giant briefing dumps

**GAP-6: No L2 E1-E5 execution receipts**
- apps_qna lacks L2 stage modules (e1_prep, e2_valid, e3_exec, e4_heal, e5_seal)
- No `L2.E1.qna_execution_context_bound` receipts
- No manifest with evidence refs, tiering, card hashes
- Impact: Cannot prove deterministic execution; no sealed artifacts

**GAP-7: No Exit v6 / X3 integration**
- apps_qna has no `exit_wiring.py`
- No `ExitReviewPacket` with evidence coverage, tier coverage, source refs
- No single X3 disposition emission
- Impact: No governed exit control; L6 could mutate current run

**GAP-8: No cache safety (R1A exact / R1B advisory)**
- No R1A exact cache with full digest match
- No R1B semantic cache advisory-only enforcement
- Risk of silent similar-pack return
- Impact: Could return wrong interviewer panel, stale overlay

**GAP-9: Local output mislabeled as durable**
- Current `reports/qna/<slug>/` output called UWG write in some contexts
- No distinction between local sealed artifact vs L4/UWG durable state
- Impact: Violates state boundary; L2 could write L4 directly

**GAP-10: Template placeholders and generic shells**
- Current templates have minimal placeholders (better than most apps)
- But Tier 1 cards not compact; Tier 2 lacks narrow trigger metadata
- No egress verifier card with source collision rules
- Impact: Generic packs; internal label leakage; fake precision

---

## Execution Plan

### P0 — Entrypoint Purity and Core Route Resolution

**Scope**: Prevent apps_qna from behaving like a standalone static card runner. Establish governance tests, registry scaffold, and entrypoint target.

**P0.1 Governance Tests**:

Create or update tests:
- `tests/governance/test_apps_qna_entrypoint_purity.py`
- `tests/governance/test_apps_qna_route_resolution.py`
- `tests/governance/test_apps_qna_no_legacy_static_runner.py`
- `tests/governance/test_apps_qna_c0_boundary.py`
- `tests/governance/test_apps_qna_l4_write_boundary.py`
- `tests/governance/test_apps_qna_prompt_assembly_boundary.py`

Required hard tests (1-20 per user specification):
1. `test_apps_qna_main_is_pure_shim`
2. `test_apps_qna_main_does_not_import_card_builder`
3. `test_apps_qna_main_does_not_import_c0_adapter`
4. `test_apps_qna_main_does_not_import_two_tier_router`
5. `test_apps_qna_main_does_not_import_l2_stage_modules`
6. `test_apps_qna_main_does_not_import_provider_sdks`
7. `test_apps_qna_main_does_not_import_l4_write_surfaces`
8. `test_apps_qna_main_contains_no_l2_callable_construction`
9. `test_apps_qna_main_contains_no_inline_card_render_closure`
10. `test_apps_qna_no_legacy_runner_feature_flag_for_grounded_path`
11. `test_apps_qna_legacy_static_runner_not_reachable_for_grounded_interview_path`
12. `test_apps_qna_core_runner_resolves_live_pack_capability`
13. `test_apps_qna_route_registry_selects_single_action_with_grounding_flag`
14. `test_apps_qna_grounded_route_requires_c0_or_uploaded_briefing`
15. `test_apps_qna_direct_path_uses_no_l3`
16. `test_apps_qna_route_resolution_failure_fails_closed_through_exit`
17. `test_apps_qna_no_generic_pack_when_grounding_required`
18. `test_apps_qna_no_direct_l4_writes`
19. `test_apps_qna_no_provider_calls_in_build_path`
20. `test_apps_qna_exit_emits_x3_but_does_not_write_l4`

**P0.2 Registry Scaffold**:

Create:
- `apps_qna/integrations/qna_capability_registry.py`
- `apps_qna/integrations/qna_l2_step_adapters.py`
- `apps_qna/integrations/qna_c0_adapter.py`
- `apps_qna/integrations/qna_exit_fec_producer.py`

Required exports:
- `register_live_interview_pack_capability()`
- `resolve_live_interview_pack_capability(app_name, route_id)`
- `register_qna_l2_steps()`
- `get_qna_step_adapter(step_name)`

Required routes:
- `apps_qna.live_interview_runtime_pack_v1` (R4_SINGLE_ACTION, grounding_required=true)
- `apps_qna.live_interview_runtime_pack_from_uploaded_brief_v1` (R4_SINGLE_ACTION, uploaded_briefing_required=true)

**P0.3 Entrypoint Target**:

Refactor `apps_qna/__main__.py`:
- Parse CLI args only
- Build raw request envelope only
- Call canonical agentic_core runner with `app_name="apps_qna"`
- Fail closed if runner/capability unavailable
- Never fallback to legacy static runner for grounded interview path

**Commands**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/governance/test_apps_qna_*.py -v --tb=short
python -m apps_qna --help  # verify pure entrypoint
```

**Acceptance**: 20 governance tests pass; registry scaffold compiles; entrypoint imports only CLI-safe types.

### P1.5 — Two-Tier Card Template Bodies and Domain Card Context Assembly

**Scope**: Ensure apps_qna has real, implementation-grade two-tier card templates and domain card-context assembly layer.

**P1.5.1 Domain Card Context Assembly**:

Create:
- `apps_qna/card_context/card_context_assembler.py`
- `apps_qna/card_context/context_budget.py`
- `apps_qna/card_context/overlay_compressor.py`

- `apps_qna/card_context/no_claim_list_builder.py`
- `apps_qna/card_context/domain_card_context_schema.py`

Domain Card Context Assembly owns:
- evidence-to-card-context shaping
- target overlay compression
- personalization hook selection
- no-claim list generation
- card render input construction
- card budget metadata

Must NOT:
- retrieve, route, call providers, execute tools
- emit Exit disposition, write durable state
- upgrade weak evidence to strong
- treat uploaded briefing or C0 evidence as instruction

**P1.5.2 Tier 1 Template Bodies** (5 files):

Create or update:
- `apps_qna/templates/tier_1/00_start_here_runtime_root.md.j2`
- `apps_qna/templates/tier_1/00a_source_set_and_egress_verifier.md.j2`
- `apps_qna/templates/tier_1/01_card_selection_manifest.md.j2`
- `apps_qna/templates/tier_1/03_interviewer_lens_and_company_bridge.md.j2`
- `apps_qna/templates/tier_1/nn_target_company_interviewer_overlay.md.j2`

Template body requirements:
- No placeholders, no TODO, no "insert here"
- Concrete implementation-grade live runtime instructions
- Tier 1 cards must be compact
- Target overlay must be compact and passive
- Full raw C0 briefing must not be dumped into overlay
- Every unsupported personal claim must be blocked or listed in no-claim list

**P1.5.3 Tier 2 Template Bodies** (14 files):

Create or update:
- `apps_qna/templates/tier_2/star_proof.md.j2`
- `apps_qna/templates/tier_2/star_failure_learning.md.j2`
- `apps_qna/templates/tier_2/rag_context.md.j2`

---

### W2 — C0 Adapter + Uploaded Briefing Evidence Contract

**Scope**: Implement C0 adapter boundary and uploaded briefing validation.

**W2.1 C0 Adapter**:
- `apps_qna/c0_adapter.py` calls canonical agentic_core C0
- Shape app-specific C0 request from interview config
- Return canonical FinalEvidenceContract unchanged
- Preserve C0 evidence refs, source refs, support status, freshness
- Fail closed if canonical C0 unavailable
- Never fabricate research, retrieve independently, or score evidence locally

**W2.2 Briefing Validator**:
- `apps_qna/briefing_validator.py` validates uploaded sealed briefings
- `apps_qna/types/briefing_contracts.py` defines UploadedBriefingEvidenceContract
- Fields: briefing_id, briefing_hash, created_at, max_age, source_register_ref, interviewer_coverage[], company_context_status, role_context_status, supported_claims[], unsupported_claims[], no_claim_list[], freshness_status, evidence_sufficiency, policy_hash, blueprint_hash, schema_version, audit_refs[]

**W2.3 Evidence Contract Types**:
- `apps_qna/types/evidence_contracts.py`

**W2.4 Integration**:
- L1 Planner: route to C0 path vs uploaded briefing path
- L0 Router: set flags based on evidence availability
- Fail closed if grounding required but no evidence available

**Acceptance**: C0 adapter calls canonical C0 only; briefing validator exists with all states (SUFFICIENT, STALE, INCOMPLETE, MISMATCH, INVALID_HASH, UNSAFE_ORIGIN, UNSUPPORTED); evidence contracts properly typed.

### W5 — Exit v6 + Egress Verifier + Cache Safety

**Scope**: Integrate Exit v6, egress verification, and cache safety.

**W5.1 Exit v6 Wiring**:
- `apps_qna/exit_wiring.py`
- apps_qna FEC producer attaches: route_id, route_family, execution_form, grounding_required, c0_required, c0_invoked, uploaded_briefing_used, evidence sufficiency, interviewer/company/role coverage, source register, no-claim list, target overlay coverage, Tier 1/2 card lists, card selection manifest, card budget report, egress verifier presence, forbidden label scan, unsupported claim scan, fake precision scan, local artifact path, manifest hash
- Exit emits exactly one X3: ALLOW_FINISH, SAFE_ABSTAIN, SAFE_FALLBACK, REROUTE, ESCALATE_HITL, DENY/BLOCK_COMMIT

**W5.2 Egress Verifier**:
- Embedded in L2.E3
- Final verifier role: source collision rule, unsupported claim blocking, fake precision blocking, no invented metrics, no unsupported company/interviewer claims, no forced company bridge for pure technical questions, no vendor-first technical answer, readout realism check

**W5.3 Cache Safety R1A/R1B**:
- R1A Exact Cache: requires full material digest match (interview YAML hash, company/role/interviewer identity, template registry version, evidence snapshot hash, policy_hash, blueprint_hash)
- R1B Semantic Cache: advisory only, never silent terminal return
- Must not silently return similar prior pack with wrong interviewer or stale overlay

**W5.4 R5 Fallback**:
- Emergency degraded pack only when explicitly degraded
- Clearly marked degraded, no personalization claims
- Minimal Tier 1 controls only
- Pass through Exit as SAFE_FALLBACK

**Acceptance**: Exit emits exactly one X3; egress verifier blocks internal labels and fake precision; cache safety prevents silent wrong-pack return; R5 fallback marked degraded.

- Document rubric, threshold, hitl_policy
- Document gate run command
- Document ledger pointers

**W6.4 Acceptance Verification**:
- Create `tests/test_w6_acceptance.py` with 57 governance test sweep
- Verify negative controls fail closed
- Verify acceptance criteria per user specification

**Commands**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/governance/test_apps_qna_*.py tests/test_w0_apps_qna_thin_slice.py tests/test_w6_acceptance.py -v
python -m apps_qna --interview acceptance-test --company TestCo --dry-run
```

**Acceptance**: 57 governance tests pass; RUNBOOK updated; legacy path quarantined or shimmed; acceptance criteria verification complete.

---

## Rules

1. **Entrypoint purity**: `__main__.py` is pure shim; never imports builder, C0 adapter, L2 stages, provider SDKs, L4 write surfaces
2. **Capability registry**: agentic_core owns route/capability resolution; apps_qna owns domain declarations and adapters only
3. **Direct path uses no L3**: Default apps_qna is not an L3 managed workflow; no Hop 1/2/3/4 terminology in direct path
4. **C0 grounding**: `grounding_required=true` requires canonical C0 FinalEvidenceContract or valid UploadedBriefingEvidenceContract
5. **C0 adapter boundary**: C0 adapter calls canonical C0 only; never retrieves independently, fabricates research, or scores evidence locally
6. **Briefing is not C0 FEC**: UploadedBriefingEvidenceContract is distinct from C0 FinalEvidenceContract; never mislabel
7. **Domain card context assembly**: Explicitly not canonical Prompt Assembly; no PA unless emitting CompiledPromptArtifact
8. **Two-tier cards**: Tier 1 always-on (compact), Tier 2 specialist (trigger-selected with narrow metadata)
9. **Router selects exactly one**: Ambiguity resolved by precedence, not card accumulation
10. **Target overlay compact**: Passive, evidence-backed, no raw briefing dump
11. **L2 heal discipline**: Cannot invent facts, retrieve, call provider, change route, upgrade weak evidence, write L4
12. **Exit exactly one X3**: Exit emits exactly one X3 disposition; no multiple X3s
13. **Local output ≠ UWG**: `reports/qna/<slug>/` is local sealed artifact, not UWG/L4 durable state
14. **L6 after runtime only**: L6 learns only after Exit; never mutates current run
15. **Negative controls fail closed**: All failure modes result in safe abstain, fallback, or exit denial

## Rollback Strategy

If things go wrong:
1. Revert `apps_qna/__main__.py` to pre-P0 state (legacy runner still functional)
2. Remove governance tests (do not break existing test suite)
3. Delete W0-W6 created files (keep P0.2 registry scaffold for future attempts)
4. Restore `apps_qna/spine_manifest.yaml` to original state
5. Document failure mode in plan file for next attempt

---

## Acceptance Criteria

| Metric | Target | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| Governance tests passing | 57/57 | `pytest tests/governance/test_apps_qna_*.py` |
| W0 thin-slice tests passing | 11/11 | `pytest tests/test_w0_apps_qna_thin_slice.py` |
| Entrypoint import count | ≤5 imports | Static analysis of `__main__.py` |
| Route contracts emitted | 2 routes | U0/L1/L0 integration tests |
| X3 dispositions per run | Exactly 1 | Exit wiring tests |
| Direct L4 writes | 0 | Governance tests + ADG edge check |
| Template placeholders | 0 | Manual review + lint |
| Legacy path functional | Yes (deprecated) | Backward compatibility test |

## Cascade Alignment Checks

- **Plan type**: refactor → ADG graph-layer evidence required (§22)
- **Tier**: T3 (multi-wave, cross-layer, architecture decisions)
- **Structured reasoning**: SR_INTAKE → SR_PLAN → SR_APPROVAL → SR_EXECUTE → SR_VERIFY
- **ADG first**: Hotspot report + graph-layer evidence sections present
- **Memory lifecycle**: Session start recalled; plan-end writeback to memory/notion required
- **MCP serialization**: Remote MCPs (notion) one-per-response per §25
- **Notion wave deferral**: Mid-plan Notion writes blocked per §35; batch at plan completion
