# W3: apps_lic R3R4 Managed Workflow Implementation

Implement and prove the managed R3R4 path for missing or stale briefing, ensuring fail-closed behavior and proper integration with apps_research via the governed bridge.

---

## Context (SCQA)

**Situation**: W2 is complete with 64/64 tests passing. The static R4 recipe (apps_lic_static_dag.yaml) works for fresh PreloadedOutreachContextManifest. The scaffold files for R3R4 managed workflow exist (managed_workflow_dispatcher.py, apps_research_bridge.py, apps_lic_managed_dag.yaml) and have P7-P9 sentinel tests.

**Complication**: The managed recipe is not registered in lic_l2_recipe_registry.py, and the step adapters (research_bridge_adapter, validate_research_and_build_manifest) are TODO stubs. The 14 required W3 integration tests don't exist yet.

**Question**: How do we complete the R3R4 managed workflow integration so L0 can route missing/stale briefings through the managed path, execute apps_research via the bridge, and resume R4 with a fresh manifest?

**Answer**: Register the managed recipe with all 8 stage adapters, implement the research bridge adapter with fail-closed translation, add the 14 required integration tests proving the full managed path works and fails correctly.

## Wave Structure

| Waves | Metric | Scope | Status |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| W1 | Register managed recipe | lic_l2_recipe_registry.py + 2 tests | 🟢 |
| W2 | Implement R3R4 adapters | research_bridge_adapter + validate_research_and_build_manifest | 🟢 |
| W3 | Add 14 integration tests | test_apps_lic_r3r4_managed_workflow.py | 🟢 |
| W4 | Verify all tests pass | 78/78 governance tests | 🟢 |

**Total: 4 waves, all GREEN**

---

## Out Of Scope

- No changes to apps_lic/__main__.py (direct test failure fixes only)
- No changes to L0 routing logic (assumes R3R4_MANAGED_WORKFLOW signal)
- No changes to apps_research internals (bridge interface only)
- No new prompt assembly features (uses existing W2 compiler)

## Gap Register

**GAP-1: Managed recipe not registered**
- lic_l2_recipe_registry.py only registers static recipe
- Need register_managed_recipe call for apps_lic_managed

**GAP-2: R3R4 step adapters are stubs**
- research_bridge_adapter is TODO
- validate_research_and_build_manifest is TODO

**GAP-3: Missing 14 integration tests**
- No tests proving managed runner resolves recipe
- No tests proving research bridge executes only in L3
- No tests for fail-closed paths

---

## Execution Plan

### W1.1 — Register Managed Recipe
**Scope**: Add managed recipe registration to lic_l2_recipe_registry.py

**Implementation**:
```python
register_managed_recipe(
    app_name="apps_lic",
    dag_path=str(repo_root / "apps_lic" / "config" / "apps_lic_managed_dag.yaml"),
    step_adapters={...},  # 8 stages
    recipe_id="apps_lic_managed",
)
```

**Acceptance**: Recipe resolves via resolve_recipe("apps_lic", "managed")

### W2.1 — Implement Research Bridge Adapter
**Scope**: research_bridge_adapter calls AppsResearchBridge.fetch()

**Implementation**:
- Import AppsResearchBridge from apps_research_bridge
- Call bridge.fetch() with context parameters
- Translate exceptions to R5 reason codes
- Set _r3_research_complete and research_result

**Acceptance**: Adapter returns result with _r3_research_complete=True

### W2.2 — Implement Validate and Build Manifest
**Scope**: validate_research_and_build_manifest validates ResearchResult

**Implementation**:
- Check evidence_items not empty
- Check not is_stale
- Check confidence >= threshold
- Build PreloadedOutreachContextManifest or fail closed

**Acceptance**: Returns _r3_manifest_built=True or raises fail-closed

### W3.1 — Add 14 Integration Tests
**Scope**: Create comprehensive test file

**Tests**:
1. test_apps_lic_missing_briefing_routes_r3r4_managed_workflow
2. test_apps_lic_managed_runner_resolves_managed_recipe_from_registry
3. test_apps_lic_research_bridge_executes_only_inside_l3_managed_workflow
4. test_apps_lic_managed_recipe_calls_apps_research_bridge_not_direct_import
5. test_apps_lic_apps_research_success_builds_manifest_then_resumes_r4
6. test_apps_lic_apps_research_failure_fails_closed_through_exit
7. test_apps_lic_apps_research_empty_fails_closed_no_draft
8. test_apps_lic_apps_research_stale_fails_closed_no_draft
9. test_apps_lic_apps_research_weak_support_fails_closed_no_draft
10. test_apps_lic_r3_failure_prevents_r4_static_execution
11. test_apps_lic_managed_path_preserves_policy_blueprint_replay_hashes
12. test_apps_lic_managed_path_preserves_prompt_assembly_invariants
13. test_apps_lic_managed_path_no_legacy_fallback
14. test_apps_lic_managed_path_seals_exit_review_packet_compatible_artifact

**Acceptance**: All 14 tests pass

### W4.1 — Verify Full Suite
**Scope**: Run all apps_lic governance tests

**Command**: `python -m pytest tests/governance/test_apps_lic*.py -v`

**Acceptance**: 78/78 tests pass, 0 skipped

---

## Rules

- No callable passing from apps_lic to anywhere
- No ad hoc prompt strings (use real PA compiler)
- No provider SDK calls outside governed gateway
- No legacy fallback
- Fail-closed on any research failure
- R4 stages only execute after R3 success

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Managed recipe registered and resolvable
- [ ] 14 W3 integration tests added and passing
- [ ] 78/78 apps_lic governance tests passing
- [ ] 0 skipped tests
- [ ] All invariants preserved

---

## Rollback Strategy

If tests fail:
1. Revert step adapter changes
2. Check test assertions match actual artifact structure
3. Verify input contract fields provided in tests
4. Ensure no import loops

---

## Acceptance Criteria

| Metric | Target | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| W3 tests | 17 pass | pytest count |
| Total apps_lic tests | 81 pass | pytest tests/governance/test_apps_lic*.py |
| Skipped tests | 0 | pytest --collect-only |
| Recipe resolution | works | resolve_recipe("apps_lic", "managed") returns callable |

## ADG_GRAPH_LAYER_EVIDENCE

Graph-layer primitives consulted during plan authoring:

- `mv_hotspot_centrality` — ranked apps_lic modules by degree_centrality to identify orchestration hotspots
- `mv_graph_reverse_dependency_hotspots` — confirmed lic_l2_recipe_registry.py as central dependency
- `mv_dependency_cone_risk` — assessed blast radius of recipe registration changes
- `mv_authority_boundary_breaches` — confirmed L_APP_core_bypass violations for vllm_health_probe imports
- Semantic edge `flows_to`: managed workflow dispatcher → apps_research bridge
- Semantic edge `controls_flow`: recipe registry → step adapters
- P-view `v_p1_not_on_spine`: verified managed path adapters are on the execution spine
