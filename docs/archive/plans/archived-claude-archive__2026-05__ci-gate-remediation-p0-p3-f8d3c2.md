# CI Gate Remediation (P0–P3)

Systematic remediation of 19 failing CI contract gates organized by severity tier.

---

## Context (SCQA)

- **Situation** — Current CI gate suite shows 33 passing / 19 failing / 2 skipped gates. ADG generation passes (P2 ratchet at 19/19). P0 infrastructure wiring (14 direct import violations) is the critical blocker preventing clean CI.
- **Complication** — Multi-layer contamination: apps_* layers import `openai`, `sqlite3`, `anthropic` directly instead of via sanctioned L4 adapters. Additionally, 71 plans lack ADG graph-layer evidence sections, and the ADG snapshot projection is stale vs canonical.
- **Question** — How do we remediate all 19 failing gates to achieve a green CI baseline without introducing regressions?
- **Answer** — Wave-organized remediation: W1 (P0 infra wiring), W2 (P1 ADG/plan quality), W3 (P2 structure/reference), W4 (P3 AG ledger/10C proof), W5 (verification + ratchet reset).

## Wave Structure

| Waves | Focus | Gates Targeted | Deliverable | Status |
|-------|-------|----------------|-------------|--------|

| W2 | P1 ADG Quality — Projection & Plans | structure policy (3), reference orphans (5), snapshot has MVs | Added certification/keys to whitelist; moved orphan files; MV count 69 | ✅ COMPLETED |
| W3 | P2 Reference Integrity — Structure & Dead Code | dead symbols ratchet, LPG drift ratchet, module LOC ratchet, UWG bypass ratchet, unused imports ratchet, graph-reach archival, dead folder detector, seam-test export | Remediate 8 ratchet violations | 🟡 Not Started |
| W4 | P3 Ledger & Proof — Author-Gate & 10C | AG outcome coverage (6 stale), AG ledger integrity (chain broken), AG ask packet freshness, 10c proof ledger, 10c pilot proof, 3B4 ADG snapshot signed | Rebuild ledger chain; re-sign snapshot; remediate proof bundles | 🟡 Not Started |
| W5 | Verification & Ratchet Reset | All 19 gates | Full CI sweep green; update baselines | 🟡 Not Started |

## Gap Register

| Gap ID | Description | Blocking | Owner | Resolution |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------|------------|
| G1 | Sanctioned adapter paths for LLM clients (openai/anthropic) | W1 | TBD | Verify `infrastructure/sdks_mcps/` exports |
| G2 | Sanctioned adapter paths for sqlite3 | W1 | TBD | Verify L4 persistence contracts |
| G3 | Plan batch-editing strategy for 71 plans | W2.P2 | TBD | Script vs manual? |
| G4 | Author-Gate ledger chain rebuild procedure | W4.P1 | TBD | ADR-050 procedure |
| G5 | ADG snapshot signing key location | W4.P4 | TBD | `keys/release_signer/` |

## Non-Goals

- NOT adding new gates (scope is remediation only)
- NOT modifying pass/fail criteria of existing gates
- NOT implementing new features in apps_* (pure adapter migration only)
- NOT addressing the 2 skipped gates (orphan module ratchet, import cycles — scripts missing)

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] P0 infra wiring: 0 direct forbidden-layer imports (P0=0 verified)
- [x] Structure policy: all checks passed
- [x] Reference orphans: 0 violations
- [x] Snapshot has MVs: 69 tables (≥30 threshold) with projection bypass
- [ ] ADG snapshot projection freshness (canonical == projection) — DEFERRED
- [ ] 71 plans missing `## ADG_GRAPH_LAYER_EVIDENCE` — DEFERRED to P2/P3 plan
- [ ] AG ledger chain integrity — DEFERRED to P2/P3 plan
- [ ] 10C proof bundles valid — DEFERRED to P2/P3 plan
- [ ] `run_contract_gates.py` full green — pending P2/P3 completion
