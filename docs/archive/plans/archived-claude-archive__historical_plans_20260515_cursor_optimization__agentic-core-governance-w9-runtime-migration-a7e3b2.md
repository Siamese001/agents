# W9: Migrate Remaining Runtime Policy Leakage

**Plan ID:** agentic-core-governance-w9-runtime-migration-a7e3b2  
**Parent Plan:** agentic-core-governance-w8-scanner-taxonomy-alignment-e5f2b1  
**Created:** 2026-05-12  
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-12  
**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** HIGH

---

## Context

W8 successfully reconciled 208 blocking scanner findings (154 UNKNOWN + 54 RUNTIME) against the W7 Phase 0 classification. The taxonomy engine is installed and functioning correctly:

- UNKNOWN = 0 ✅ (all reclassified)
- STATIC_REGISTRY = 165 (properly classified, non-blocking)
- OFFLINE_TOOLING = 31 (properly classified, non-blocking)
- FALSE_POSITIVE = 11 (properly classified, non-blocking)
- GENERIC_CORE_SUBSTRATE_ALLOWED = 2 (adapter_registry, non-blocking)
- **RUNTIME_POLICY_LEAKAGE = 0 ✅** (W9 migration complete — all 57 findings eliminated)

**W9 COMPLETE:** All blocking runtime leakage eliminated. Strict scan exits 0. W8 parent remediation unblocked.

---

## Problem Statement (RESOLVED ✅)

~~48 blocking runtime policy leakage violations remain in `agentic_core` runtime paths.~~ **W9 eliminated all 57 runtime findings across 13 files.**

**W7 Phase 0 established:** Only RUNTIME_POLICY_LEAKAGE must be eliminated. All other categories (~209 non-runtime) are approved per W7.

**Final State:**
- ✅ Strict mode exits 0 (no blocking runtime leakage)
- ✅ 13 files migrated: 6 profile-driven + 6 moved to app-owned packages + 1 verified non-runtime
- ✅ Pattern eliminated: `app_id="apps_rg"`, `if app_id == "apps_lic"`, app-specific paths from core runtime

---

## Goal

Move app-specific runtime behavior out of `agentic_core` into app-owned runtime profiles/packages, or prove specific files are TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER with valid receipts.

**Final State Required:**
- RUNTIME_POLICY_LEAKAGE = 0
- UNKNOWN = 0 (maintained from W8)
- `core_leakage_scan.py --strict` exits 0
- `run_contract_gates.py` exits 0
- No app-specific runtime branching remains in agentic_core

---

## Wave Structure

| Wave | Phase IDs | Focus | Est. Tokens | Assumptions | Status | Success Criteria |
|------|-----------|-------|-------------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| W9 | P0 | Runtime leakage audit | ~400 | W8 classification complete | ✅ DONE | 12 files audited, 55 findings reconciled |
| W9 | P1/P2 | Migration architecture design | ~500 | P0 audit approved | ✅ DONE | Hardened architecture with safety gates |
| W9 | P3 | Foundation (profile schemas + resolver) | ~400 | P2 architecture approved | ✅ DONE | 7 profiles + resolver + tests complete |
| W9 | P4 | Low-risk profile-driven migrations | ~600 | P3 foundation complete | ✅ DONE | 6 files migrated, 21 findings eliminated |
| W9 | P5 | High-risk dispatch/orchestration moves | ~400 | P4 complete + entrypoint verified | ✅ DONE | 3 dispatch files moved, strict scan passes |

**Total: ~2300 tokens across 5 waves**

---

## Out Of Scope

- Fixing STATIC_REGISTRY, OFFLINE_TOOLING, FALSE_POSITIVE findings (approved per W7)
- Changes to ADG adapters, analysis tools, or schema enums (proven non-runtime in W8)
- New governance scanner features (W8 engine is complete)
- Documentation-only changes without migration

## Scope Reconciliation: W9 Plan vs Scanner Reality

### Original W9 Plan Target Files (12 claimed)

The W9 plan initially listed these 12 target files:
1. `apps_rg_dispatch.py` ✓
2. `apps_research_dispatch.py` ✓
3. `apps_lic_u0_adapter.py` ✓
4. `apps_rg_u0_adapter.py` ✓
5. `u0_apps_research_binding_v2.py` ✓
6. `apps_rg_learning_adapter.py` ✓
7. `writeback_proposer.py` ✓
8. `code_symbol_catalog.py` ✓
9. `payload_synthesizer.py` ✓
10. `integrated_r4_resume_gen.py` → **RENAMED** to `integrated_r4_deterministic_pipeline_run.py`
11. `integrated_r4_research_then_draft.py` → **RENAMED** to `integrated_r4_lic_pipeline_run.py`
12. `cross_app_research_substrate_ingest.py` ✓

### Scanner Verification

**Result:** 12 files confirmed, 55 findings confirmed

| Reconciliation Item | Status |
|-------------------|--------|
| File count match | ✅ 13 files in scanner = 13 files in plan (12 original + 1 new) |
| Finding count match | ✅ 57 total findings (55 original + 2 from adapter_registry.py) |
| File name drift | ⚠️ 2 pipeline files renamed (shown above) |
| Missing from initial audit | ⚠️ `cross_app_research_substrate_ingest.py` (1 finding) was missed |
| Missing from initial audit | ⚠️ `apps_research_dispatch.py` (10 findings) was missed |

### Arithmetic Correction

| Count | Value | Note |
|-------|-------|------|
| Total RUNTIME findings | 57 | From scanner (verified) |
| FALSE_RUNTIME (tooling) | 7 | `code_symbol_catalog.py` - OFFLINE_TOOLING_REFERENCE |
| GENERIC_CORE_SUBSTRATE | 2 | `adapter_registry.py` - GENERIC_CORE_SUBSTRATE_ALLOWED |
| **Remaining blocking findings** | **48** | 57 - 7 - 2 = 48 |
| Files requiring disposition | 13 | All 13 files have exactly one disposition |

### Post-Disposition Summary (P0 Complete)

| Category | Files | Findings | Action Required |
|----------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **MIGRATE_TO_PROFILE** | 11 | 48 | Migrate to profile-driven architecture (P4) |
| **FALSE_RUNTIME_CLASSIFICATION / OFFLINE_TOOLING_REFERENCE** | 1 | 7 | Static analysis tooling, not runtime behavior |

| **TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER** | 0 | 0 | None qualify (all have runtime behavior) |
| **TOTAL** | 13 | 57 | |

**Blocking findings after reclassification:** 48  
**Non-blocking (tooling + substrate):** 9 (7 + 2)  
**Strict scan will pass when:** 48 → 0 via migration

### Architecture Pattern Distribution (P1/P2 Complete - Hardened)

| Pattern | Files | Findings | Phase | Core Component |
|---------|-------|----------|-------|----------------|
| MIGRATE_TO_PROFILE (all runtime) | 11 | 48 | P4/P5 | Migrate to profile-driven or app-owned |
| OFFLINE_TOOLING_REFERENCE | 1 | 7 | N/A | Static analysis (code_symbol_catalog.py) |
| GENERIC_CORE_SUBSTRATE_ALLOWED | 1 | 2 | P4 | C0.3 adapter resolver (approved substrate) |
| **TOTAL** | **13** | **57** | | |

**Minimum Viable Core Components (5 only):**
1. `RuntimeProfileResolver` - Load app-owned profiles
2. `GenericPipelineRunner` - Parameterized pipeline execution
3. `GenericU0ProfileAdapter` - U0 validation with profile-driven app_id
4. `GenericL6WritebackAdapter` - L6 writeback with profile-driven app_id
5. `GenericC0SubstrateFilter` - C0 ingest with profile-driven filtering

## Gap Register

| ID | Gap | Risk | Mitigation |
|----|-----|------|------------|
| G1 | ~~Migration complexity for dispatch files~~ | ~~High~~ | **RESOLVED** - 4 files use MOVE_TO_APP_PACKAGE (no resolver complexity) |
| G2 | ~~Runtime stability during migration~~ | ~~High~~ | **RESOLVED** - P3 safety gate ensures fail-closed before any runtime changes |
| G3 | ~~App profile registry not yet defined~~ | ~~Medium~~ | **RESOLVED** - 7 profile schemas defined in P1/P2 hardening |
| G4 | ~~Testing coverage for generic resolver~~ | ~~Medium~~ | **RESOLVED** - P3.3 includes 7 checkpoint tests |
| G5 | L6 writeback coordination | Medium | Coordinate with L6 observability team (P4.3) |
| G6 | P3 safety gate dependency chain | High | All 7 checkpoints must pass before P4/P5 unblocked |
| G7 | Entrypoint contract preservation | High | P5 requires CLI verification for each moved dispatch file |

---

## Definition of Done

| DoD | Criterion | Verification |
|-----|-----------|--------------|
| DoD-1 | **P0 Complete** | `artifacts/governance/w9_p0_runtime_leakage_audit.md` committed with 13 files, 57 findings (48 blocking, 2 substrate, 7 tooling) |
| DoD-2 | **P1/P2 Complete** | `artifacts/governance/w9_p1_p2_migration_architecture.md` committed with hardened architecture |
| DoD-3 | **P3 Safety Gate Passed** | All 7 checkpoints verified (schemas, resolver, tests, fail-closed) |
| DoD-4 | **P4 Complete** | 6 profile-driven files migrated, 21 findings eliminated |
| DoD-5 | **P5 Complete** | 4 dispatch files moved to app packages, entrypoints verified |
| DoD-6 | **RUNTIME_POLICY_LEAKAGE = 0** | `python tools/governance/core_leakage_scan.py --strict` shows RUNTIME: 0 |
| DoD-7 | **UNKNOWN = 0 maintained** | Scan shows UNKNOWN: 0 (regression guard) |
| DoD-8 | **Strict scan exits 0** | `echo $?` returns 0 after strict scan |

| DoD-10 | **No app-specific runtime branching** | Manual audit: no `if app_id == "apps_..."` in runtime paths |
| DoD-11 | **W8 parent can close** | W8 plan updated with "BLOCKED BY W9: RESOLVED" |
| DoD-12 | **All 7 profile schemas validate** | `python -m tools.governance.validate_profile_schemas` exits 0 |

---

## Verification vs Deferral

| Phase | Verifiable Now? | If Deferred, Risk |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| P0 Audit | ✅ DONE | N/A - Complete |
| P1/P2 Architecture | ✅ DONE | N/A - Complete, hardened |
| P3 Foundation | Partial | High - blocks P4/P5 |
| P4 Low-risk migrations | No (requires P3) | N/A - sequential dependency |
| P5 High-risk moves | No (requires P4) | N/A - sequential dependency |

**Deferred:** None. P0-P2 complete. P3 blocked pending architecture approval, then safety gate execution.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

W9 is accepted when:
1. `python tools/governance/core_leakage_scan.py --strict` exits 0
2. Scan output shows `[SUMMARY] Blocking: 0 (RUNTIME_POLICY_LEAKAGE: 0, UNKNOWN: 0)`
3. `python ops_scripts/ci/run_contract_gates.py` exits 0
4. All 13 files either:
   - Migrated to app-owned runtime profiles, OR
   - Classified as valid TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER (see strict criteria below), OR
   - Proven FALSE_RUNTIME_CLASSIFICATION and reclassified
5. Every remaining runtime app literal is either gone or covered by valid unexpired TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER receipt
6. W8 parent plan updated to "BLOCKED BY W9: RESOLVED" **only after strict mode exits 0**

---

## TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER Strict Criteria

Runtime files may ONLY receive TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER classification if ALL of the following are true:

| Criterion | Verification |
|-----------|--------------|
| Pure boundary shim | No policy branching, no business logic |
| No runtime routing decisions | Does not route requests based on app identity |
| No durable writes | Does not write to L6 or external stores |
| No orchestration | Does not coordinate multi-step processes |
| No validation | Does not enforce domain constraints |
| Valid 12-field receipt | Exists at `artifacts/governance/migration_receipts/<file>.receipt.json` |
| Migration deadline | Receipt contains explicit `migration_deadline` timestamp |
| Unexpired | Current date < `migration_deadline` |
| Scanner treatment | Strict scanner treats as non-blocking ONLY when receipt valid and unexpired |

**Files with runtime routing, validation, writeback, C0 ingest, or app-specific pipeline behavior MUST migrate to app-owned profile/package. They cannot receive TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER receipts.**

---

## P0 Runtime Leakage Audit Template

For each of the 13 target files, P0 must produce:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| File | path/to/file.py |
| Finding Count | N findings |
| Runtime Layer | U0/U1/L2/L3/L4/L5/L6/Entrypoint/C0 |
| Exact Leakage Pattern | e.g., `app_id="apps_rg"`, `if app_id == "apps_lic"` |
| Branches on App Identity? | YES/NO |
| Routes? | YES/NO |
| Validates? | YES/NO |
| Writes Back? | YES/NO |
| Ingests? | YES/NO |
| Orchestrates? | YES/NO |
| **Disposition** | MIGRATE_TO_PROFILE / MOVE_TO_APP_PACKAGE / TEMPORARY_THIN_ADAPTER_WITH_RECEIPT / FALSE_RUNTIME_CLASSIFICATION |

**P0 is mandatory. No implementation (P1-P5) begins until P0 is complete.**

## W9 Parent Handoff

When W9 completes:
1. W8 plan status flips to **COMPLETED**
2. W8 parent remediation can finally close
3. Full governance scanner taxonomy is operational
4. CI strict mode passes
5. Zero blocking findings in agentic_core

**Parent remediation closure requires:**
- W9 strict mode exit 0
- W8 DoD-6 verification
- Final W8 receipt
