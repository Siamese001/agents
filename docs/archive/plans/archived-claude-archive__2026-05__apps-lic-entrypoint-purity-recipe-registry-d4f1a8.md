# apps_lic Entrypoint Purity, Recipe Registry Resolution, and Prompt Assembly

Prevent the apps_rg intermediate wiring pattern by ensuring apps_lic/__main__.py never builds, passes, or owns a handmade l2_callable closure. Full agentic_core-owned recipe resolution and Prompt Assembly-governed prompt compilation with real implementation-grade template bodies before any W1 implementation.

---

## Context (SCQA)

**Situation** — The apps_lic/__main__.py currently delegates to `apps_lic.tools.run_workflow_lic` which imports HOP agents directly, creates an orchestrator, and executes legacy domain logic. The DAG YAMLs exist (`apps_lic_static_dag.yaml`, `apps_lic_managed_dag.yaml`) but are not bound to a recipe registry or resolved by agentic_core. Prompts are ad hoc strings hidden inside compose agents. Without explicit Prompt Assembly with real template bodies, apps_lic could have clean entrypoint and L2 recipe wiring while still hiding ad hoc prompt strings or using placeholder templates.

**Complication** — The apps_rg intermediate state demonstrated a partial improvement: apps_rg/__main__.py now delegates to the R4 runner and fails closed if the runner is missing, but it still builds a handmade l2_callable closure that directly runs legacy domain execution. This is better than the original failure (no R4 delegation), but not the final architecture because agentic_core does not yet own L2 recipe resolution. Additionally, without real implementation-grade prompt template bodies, apps_lic could evade governance through placeholder prompt files that exist but do not contain governed LIC instructions.

**Question** — How do we ensure apps_lic achieves the final architecture (pure shim + agentic_core-owned recipe resolution + Prompt Assembly with real template bodies) without passing through the same intermediate state that apps_rg did, and without allowing placeholder templates or ad hoc prompt strings to evade governance?

**Answer** — Add P0 and P1.5 blocker phases before W1 that harden entrypoint purity, recipe registry resolution, and Prompt Assembly with real implementation-grade template bodies, with 40 hard governance tests that fail if __main__.py constructs l2_callable closures; fails closed without legacy fallback; violates provider-call boundaries; uses ad hoc prompt strings; or contains placeholder templates.

## Out Of Scope

- Real HOP agent implementation (MessagePlanner, compose agents) — adapters only
- Provider calls (Gemini, etc) — L2 step adapters use governed provider gateway only
- L4 durable writes — Exit V6 emits CommitRequest → UWG → L4 only
- DOCX/artifact export — handled by Exit pipeline, not __main__.py
- apps_research internal changes — only the bridge interface
- Changes to apps_lic/config/domain_contract/ — read-only

## Gap Register

**GAP-1: L2 recipe resolver not yet importing apps_lic**
- The `agentic_core.runtime.l2_recipe_resolver` may not yet have an entry for apps_lic
- Resolution: Add apps_lic entry to the core registry during W1.2

**GAP-2: HOP agents not yet wrapped as step adapters**
- HOP1ProfileAnalysisAgent, HOP2ResearchAgent, HOP3SenderGroundingAgent execute directly in legacy code
- Resolution: Wrap each as L2 step adapters during W2.1

**GAP-3: AppsResearchBridge may need interface alignment**
- Current bridge may not expose the expected interface for L3 managed workflow step adapter
- Resolution: Align bridge interface during W3.2

**GAP-4: Manifest types may need Exit V6 alignment**
- PreloadedOutreachContextManifest and ResearchResult types need to flow through Exit receipts
- Resolution: Verify type compatibility during W3.3

**GAP-5: Governed provider gateway may not expose capability for apps_lic**
- L3 step adapters need to call generation through canonical gateway, not direct SDK
- Resolution: Verify gateway exposes required capability during W2.1

**GAP-6: Prompt Assembly may not be integrated for apps_lic**
- No lic_pa_compiler exists; prompts are ad hoc strings in compose agents
- Resolution: Build lic_pa_compiler and prompt registry during P1.5

**GAP-7: Template bodies may be placeholders**
- Windsurf could create empty, vague, or placeholder prompt YAML files
- Resolution: P1.5.5 validates implementation-grade template body content, not placeholders

---

## Execution Plan

### P0 — Entrypoint Purity and Recipe Registry Resolution (BLOCKER)
**Scope**: Establish hard governance tests and scaffold registry/step adapters before any implementation. P0 is not accepted until tests are proven meaningful.

**P0.1 Governance test scaffold** (15 hard tests):
```bash
# Create tests/governance/ directory if absent
mkdir -p tests/governance/
```

Entrypoint/Recipe/Provider/Write tests (15 tests):
1. `test_apps_lic_main_contains_no_l2_callable_construction`
2. `test_apps_lic_main_does_not_import_hop_agents`
3. `test_apps_lic_main_does_not_import_apps_research`
4. `test_apps_lic_r4_runner_resolves_static_recipe_from_registry`
5. `test_apps_lic_managed_runner_resolves_managed_recipe_from_registry`
6. `test_apps_lic_hops_execute_only_as_registered_l2_steps`
7. `test_apps_lic_research_bridge_executes_only_inside_l3_managed_workflow`
8. `test_apps_lic_recipe_resolution_failure_fails_closed_through_exit`
9. `test_apps_lic_no_generic_draft_when_recipe_missing`
10. `test_apps_lic_no_legacy_runner_feature_flag`
11. `test_apps_lic_run_workflow_lic_not_reachable_from_main`
12. `test_apps_lic_recipe_resolution_failure_does_not_fallback_to_legacy`
13. `test_apps_lic_l2_step_adapters_do_not_call_provider_sdks_directly`
14. `test_apps_lic_model_generation_uses_governed_provider_gateway`
15. `test_apps_lic_exit_emits_commit_request_but_does_not_write_l4`

**P0.2 Recipe registry adapter scaffold**:
- Create `apps_lic/integrations/lic_l2_recipe_registry.py`
- Exports `register_static_recipe(app_name, dag_path, step_adapters)`
- Exports `register_managed_recipe(app_name, dag_path, step_adapters)`
- Exports `resolve_recipe(app_name, route_family) -> Callable`
- Recipe ownership: `agentic_core` owns the recipe resolution protocol and execution lifecycle. `apps_lic` owns only domain recipe declarations and registered L2 step adapter implementations. `apps_lic/__main__.py` owns neither.

**P0.3 Step adapter scaffold with provider gateway boundary**:
- Create `apps_lic/integrations/lic_l2_step_adapters.py`
- Define E1-E5 canonical step interface
- Map apps_lic HOP stages to E1-E5 phases:
  - E1 Prep: load_manifest, validate_context
  - E2 Valid: (validation gates)
  - E3 Exec: plan_message, compose_draft
  - E4 Heal: (anti-pattern removal, length repair)
  - E5 Seal: seal_output
- Provider SDK calls are forbidden in __main__.py, L0, and raw L2 adapters.
- If generation is required, L2 step adapters must use the canonical governed model/provider gateway with policy_hash, blueprint_hash, registry binding, capability token, sandbox envelope, replay key, and audit refs.
- No direct OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, or local model SDK calls from apps_lic step adapters.

**Acceptance**:
- [ ] All 15 entrypoint/recipe test files exist
- [ ] Recipe registry scaffold imports without error
- [ ] Step adapter scaffold imports without error
- [ ] Tests are proven meaningful (not tautologies)
- [ ] No implementation wave is marked complete unless its required tests pass

### P1.5 — LIC Prompt Assembly, Prompt Registry, and Real Prompt Template Bodies (BLOCKER)
**Scope**: Ensure apps_lic outreach prompts are fully defined, registry-bound, PromptBOM-bound, compiled by `lic_pa_compiler.py`, and consumed by L2 as `CompiledPromptArtifact` objects. Prompt templates must contain real implementation-grade prompt content, not placeholders. P1.5 is not accepted until all 25 prompt tests pass and template bodies are validated as implementation-grade.

**Prompt Assembly Ownership**:
- Prompt Assembly compiles only.
- Prompt Assembly must not: retrieve, route, execute tools, call providers, mutate L4, emit Exit disposition, approve egress, or approve writes.

**L2 Ownership**:
- L2 executes bounded steps using compiled prompt artifacts.
- L2 must not assemble prompts inline.

**Provider Gateway Ownership**:
- Provider gateway invokes models only after receiving a valid CompiledPromptArtifact.

**Exit Ownership**:
- Exit reviews sealed artifacts and emits exactly one X3 disposition.

**UWG/L4 Ownership**:
- Durable writes flow only Exit V6 → CommitRequest → UWG → L4.

**P1.5.1 PromptBOM and prompt registry with real template bodies**:

**P1.5.2 lic_pa_compiler**:
- Create `apps_lic/prompt_assembly/lic_pa_compiler.py`
- Behavior: load prompt_bom.yaml, load prompt_registry.yaml, resolve template by template_id, validate required slots, validate required input contract, render structured slots, canonicalize slot bytes, compute hashes, emit CompiledPromptArtifact
- Must NOT: retrieve, route, execute, call providers, emit Exit disposition, approve egress/writes, mutate L4
- Fail closed if template missing, required slot missing, required field missing, hash mismatch, or registry mismatch

**Required CompiledPromptArtifact fields**:
- artifact_id, request_id, run_id, trace_id, route_id
- template_id, template_version
- prompt_bom_hash, prompt_registry_hash, template_hash
- manifest_hash, policy_hash, blueprint_hash, replay_key
- origin_label_map, claim_permission_map, omission_policy
- send_mode_restrictions, output_schema_ref, provider_lane
- rendered_slots, canonical_slot_bytes_hash, artifact_hash
- audit_refs

**P1.5.3 L2 prompt integration**:
- Update `lic_l2_step_adapters.py`: add `compile_prompt` step
- Update `apps_lic_static_dag.yaml`: insert `compile_prompt` before `compose_draft`, add `validate_prompt_registry_entries`, `validate_prompt_bom_slots`, `validate_template_bodies_not_placeholders` to E2 Valid
- Update `apps_lic_managed_dag.yaml`: add same validations and `compile_prompt` in R4 phase
- E3 Exec: plan_message → compile_prompt → compose_draft_using_compiled_prompt_artifact
- E4 Heal: compile_repair_prompt_if_needed → repair using repair-specific CompiledPromptArtifact
- Hard rule: compose_draft must fail closed if CompiledPromptArtifact is missing, invalid, unsigned, hash-mismatched, stale, or not bound to current manifest_hash, prompt_bom_hash, template_hash, policy_hash, blueprint_hash, and replay_key
- Hard rule: E4 repair steps must use repair-specific CompiledPromptArtifact objects. No inline repair prompt strings.
- Hard rule: governed provider gateway must reject generation requests without valid CompiledPromptArtifact

- [ ] All 5 template files exist with implementation-grade bodies
- [ ] Tests are proven meaningful
- [ ] No implementation wave is marked complete unless its required tests pass

### W1 — __main__.py Pure Shim + R4 Runner Delegation (No Legacy Fallback)
**Scope**: Convert __main__.py to pure shim, delegate to agentic_core R4 runner. Recipe resolution failure emits R5 terminal through Exit V6 — no fallback to legacy.

**W1.1 __main__.py pure shim**:
- Remove import of `apps_lic.tools.run_workflow_lic`
- Remove orchestrator creation and execution
- Add import of `run_integrated_r4_deterministic_pipeline` from agentic_core
- Parse args, build raw_request, call runner with `app_name="apps_lic"`
- Fail closed (exit 1) if runner unavailable — no fallback

**W1.2 Registry resolution wiring**:
- Register apps_lic static recipe:
  - stages: load_manifest, validate_context, plan_message, compile_prompt, compose_draft, seal_output
  - dag_path: `apps_lic/config/apps_lic_static_dag.yaml`
- Register apps_lic managed recipe:
  - stages: validate_request, request_briefing, await_briefing, validate_briefing, build_preloaded_outreach_context_manifest, compile_prompt, resume_r4_static_recipe, validate_draft, seal_output
  - dag_path: `apps_lic/config/apps_lic_managed_dag.yaml`
- agentic_core owns the recipe resolution protocol and execution lifecycle.
- apps_lic owns only domain recipe declarations and registered L2 step adapter implementations.
- apps_lic/__main__.py owns neither.

**W1.3 Fail-closed R4 delegation (no legacy fallback)**:
- Do not add `--use-legacy-runner` feature flag.
- Do not fallback to `run_workflow_lic.py`.
- If recipe resolution fails, emit terminal R5/fail-closed packet through Exit V6.
- Preserve `run_workflow_lic.py` only as quarantined legacy code until W4 cleanup.
- Add tests proving `run_workflow_lic.py` is not reachable from `apps_lic/__main__.py`, L0, R4 recipe resolution, or R3R4 recipe resolution.
- `_emit_r5_terminal_via_exit(reason_code="CAPABILITY_UNAVAILABLE")` on any resolution failure

**Acceptance**:
- [ ] `test_apps_lic_main_contains_no_l2_callable_construction` passes
- [ ] `test_apps_lic_main_does_not_import_hop_agents` passes
- [ ] `test_apps_lic_main_does_not_import_apps_research` passes
- [ ] `test_apps_lic_r4_runner_resolves_static_recipe_from_registry` passes
- [ ] `test_apps_lic_recipe_resolution_failure_fails_closed_through_exit` passes
- [ ] `test_apps_lic_no_generic_draft_when_recipe_missing` passes
- [ ] `test_apps_lic_no_legacy_runner_feature_flag` passes
- [ ] `test_apps_lic_run_workflow_lic_not_reachable_from_main` passes
- [ ] `test_apps_lic_recipe_resolution_failure_does_not_fallback_to_legacy` passes

### W2 — Static Recipe Execution (R4 Path)
**Scope**: Implement L2 step adapters for static DAG execution using governed provider gateway and CompiledPromptArtifact.

**W2.1 Static DAG step adapters with provider gateway**:
- `load_manifest`: Load PreloadedOutreachContextManifest, verify hash, check freshness
- `validate_context`: Run BriefingReady validation, emit R5 on failure
- `validate_prompt_registry_entries`: Verify prompt templates registered
- `validate_prompt_bom_slots`: Verify PromptBOM slots present
- `validate_template_bodies_not_placeholders`: Verify templates have real content
- `plan_message`: Invoke MessagePlanner via adapter using governed provider gateway, produce MessagePlan
- `compile_prompt`: Call lic_pa_compiler to produce CompiledPromptArtifact
- `compose_draft_using_compiled_prompt_artifact`: Execute hop-based draft composition using CompiledPromptArtifact via governed provider gateway
- `seal_output`: Hash OutreachDraft, emit L2 receipt
- No direct OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, or local model SDK calls.
- E4 Heal steps: `compile_repair_prompt_if_needed` → repair using repair-specific CompiledPromptArtifact

**W2.2 Static recipe execution**:
- Runner resolves static recipe from registry
- Executes E1→E2→E3→E4→E5 sequentially
- E3: plan_message → compile_prompt → compose_draft_using_compiled_prompt_artifact
- Each stage fail-closed with appropriate R5 reason code
- Output flows to Exit V6 → CommitRequest → UWG → L4

**W2.3 Static path governance tests**:
- Verify step adapters execute in correct order
- Verify manifest_hash preserved through chain
- Verify CompiledPromptArtifact.bound_to manifest_hash matches context
- Verify no unsourced claims in output
- Verify provider SDK calls only through governed gateway

**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Static path executes end-to-end with fresh manifest
- [ ] Each stage R5 code matches expected per DAG YAML
- [ ] `test_apps_lic_hops_execute_only_as_registered_l2_steps` passes
- [ ] `test_apps_lic_l2_step_adapters_do_not_call_provider_sdks_directly` passes
- [ ] `test_apps_lic_model_generation_uses_governed_provider_gateway` passes
- [ ] `test_apps_lic_compose_draft_requires_compiled_prompt_artifact` passes
- [ ] `test_apps_lic_prompt_artifact_manifest_hash_matches_context_manifest` passes

### W3 — Managed Recipe Execution (R3R4 Path)
**Scope**: Implement R3 research phase + R4 execution phase as managed workflow with governed provider gateway and CompiledPromptArtifact.

**W3.1 Managed workflow registry entry**:
- Register R3R4_MANAGED_WORKFLOW recipe
- 9 stages: 4 R3 research + 5 R4 outreach (compile_prompt + static DAG)

**W3.2 Research bridge step adapter**:
- Wrap `AppsResearchBridge.fetch()` as L3 managed workflow step
- Handle exceptions internally, return ResearchResult
- Translate failure signals to R5 reason codes:
  - is_blocked → APPS_RESEARCH_BLOCKED
  - exception → APPS_RESEARCH_FAILED
- apps_research bridge executes only as registered L3/L2 managed workflow step, never from __main__.py or L0

**W3.3 R3→R4 transition gate**:
- Stage 4: `validate_research_and_build_manifest`
- Fail-closed on research_empty, research_stale, research_weak_support
- On success: emit fresh PreloadedOutreachContextManifest
- Stage 5: `validate_prompt_registry_entries`, `validate_prompt_bom_slots`, `validate_template_bodies_not_placeholders`
- Stage 6: `compile_prompt` (using briefing_to_manifest_v1 template)
- Stage 7-9: R4 execution using compiled prompt artifact

**W3.4 Managed path governance tests**:
- Verify apps_research bridge executes only inside L3 managed workflow
- Verify no direct apps_research imports from __main__.py
- Verify R3 failure prevents R4 execution
- Verify provider gateway used for all generation
- Verify CompiledPromptArtifact required for all generation

**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Managed path executes end-to-end with missing briefing
- [ ] Research failure produces correct R5 terminal through Exit
- [ ] `test_apps_lic_research_bridge_executes_only_inside_l3_managed_workflow` passes
- [ ] `test_apps_lic_managed_runner_resolves_managed_recipe_from_registry` passes
- [ ] `test_apps_lic_missing_prompt_template_fails_closed_through_exit` passes

### W4 — Verification, Acceptance, and Legacy Cleanup
**Scope**: Full integration verification, all 40 governance tests passing, legacy code quarantine/cleanup, documentation.

**W4.1 Full integration verification**:
- End-to-end test: fresh manifest → R4 static path → Exit V6 → UWG → L4
- End-to-end test: missing briefing → R3R4 managed path → Exit V6 → UWG → L4
- Verify all 40 hard governance tests pass
- Verify Exit emits CommitRequest but does not write L4 directly
- Verify CompiledPromptArtifact present in all generation paths

**W4.2 Acceptance test sweep**:
- Run all 40 governance tests in sequence
- Verify no regressions in existing apps_lic tests
- Verify no l2_callable construction in __main__.py
- Verify no provider SDK calls outside governed gateway
- Verify no ad hoc prompt strings in active generation or repair paths

**W4.3 Legacy code quarantine and cleanup**:
- Quarantine `apps_lic/tools/run_workflow_lic.py` with deprecation notice
- Add `_QUARANTINED_LEGACY: DO NOT USE` header comment
- Schedule removal in future plan (do not delete in this plan)
- Verify `run_workflow_lic.py` is not reachable from any active code path

**W4.4 Documentation update**:
- Update `apps_lic/RUNBOOK.md` with entrypoint purity contract
- Document recipe ownership: agentic_core owns protocol, apps_lic owns declarations/adapters
- Document Prompt Assembly ownership: Prompt Assembly owns compilation, L2 owns execution, provider gateway owns model invocation, Exit owns final disposition, UWG owns durable write admission
- Document the canonical E1-E5 step adapter pattern
- Document provider gateway boundary: no direct SDK calls
- Document Prompt Assembly boundary: no ad hoc prompt strings, registry-defined templates only, no placeholders
- Document R5 reason code matrix
- Document Exit → UWG → L4 flow (Exit does not write L4 directly)

**Acceptance**:
- [ ] All 40 hard tests passing
- [ ] No l2_callable in __main__.py
- [ ] No HOP agent imports in __main__.py
- [ ] No apps_research imports in __main__.py
- [ ] No legacy runner feature flag
- [ ] `run_workflow_lic.py` quarantined and unreachable
- [ ] agentic_core owns recipe resolution protocol
- [ ] Provider SDK calls only through governed gateway
- [ ] Exit V6 emits CommitRequest but does not write L4 directly
- [ ] L2 does not write L4 directly
- [ ] apps_lic does not write L4 directly
- [ ] PromptBOM exists with 8 required slots
- [ ] Prompt registry registers 5 required templates
- [ ] Each required prompt template contains real implementation-grade body content
- [ ] lic_pa_compiler emits CompiledPromptArtifact
- [ ] compose_draft requires CompiledPromptArtifact
- [ ] L2 repair steps require repair-specific CompiledPromptArtifact
- [ ] No ad hoc prompt strings in active generation or repair paths
- [ ] Provider gateway requires CompiledPromptArtifact
- [ ] Missing prompt template fails closed through Exit V6
- [ ] Placeholder prompt templates fail tests

## Rules

1. **apps_lic/__main__.py must not build, pass, or own a handmade l2_callable closure**
2. **apps_lic/__main__.py must not import HOP agents, MessagePlanner, generation agents, validation agents, anti-pattern detector, apps_research, providers, or L4 write surfaces**
3. **No legacy fallback** — Do not add `--use-legacy-runner`. Do not fallback to `run_workflow_lic.py`. Recipe resolution failure → R5 terminal through Exit V6.
4. **Provider SDK boundary** — Provider SDK calls are forbidden in __main__.py, L0, and raw L2 adapters. If generation is required, L2 step adapters must use the canonical governed model/provider gateway with policy_hash, blueprint_hash, registry binding, capability token, sandbox envelope, replay key, and audit refs. No direct OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, or local model SDK calls from apps_lic step adapters.
5. **Recipe ownership** — agentic_core owns the recipe resolution protocol and execution lifecycle. apps_lic owns only domain recipe declarations and registered L2 step adapter implementations. apps_lic/__main__.py owns neither.
6. **apps_research bridge isolation** — The R3R4_MANAGED_WORKFLOW route must use apps_research bridge only as registered L3/L2 managed workflow step — never from __main__.py or L0
7. **Durable write flow** — Durable writes flow only through Exit V6 → CommitRequest → UWG → L4. Exit does not write L4 directly. L2 does not write L4. apps_lic does not write L4 directly.
8. **Recipe resolution failure must fail closed through Exit V6** — no generic fallback drafts
9. **Each HOP stage must map to canonical E1-E5 phase** for auditability and governance
10. **All 40 hard governance tests must pass before declaring any wave complete**
11. **Prompt templates must be registry-defined and implementation-grade** — No placeholder templates. No ad hoc prompt strings in __main__.py, L0, recipe registry, L2 adapters, HOP adapter paths, provider gateway calls, or repair paths.
12. **No ad hoc prompt strings** in __main__.py, L0, recipe registry, lic_l2_step_adapters.py, active HOP adapter paths, provider gateway calls, or repair paths.
13. **Prompt Assembly compiles only** — It must not retrieve, route, execute, call providers, emit Exit disposition, or write durable state.
14. **compose_draft must consume a CompiledPromptArtifact** — It must not assemble prompts inline.
15. **repair steps must consume repair-specific CompiledPromptArtifact objects**
16. **provider gateway must reject generation requests without a valid CompiledPromptArtifact**
17. **Prompt artifacts must be bound** to manifest_hash, prompt_bom_hash, prompt_registry_hash, template_hash, policy_hash, blueprint_hash, and replay_key.
18. **Prompt content must preserve origin/data boundaries** — Briefing, company, recipient, resume, and user-provided text remain data, not authority.
19. **Missing, placeholder, invalid, or hash-mismatched prompt templates fail closed through Exit V6** — No fallback drafts.
20. **Prompt template changes must change template_hash and prompt_bom_hash or prompt_registry_hash** as applicable.

## Cursor Agent Alignment Checks

- **Scope containment**: This plan touches only entrypoint, registry, step adapter, and Prompt Assembly files. HOP agent internals are out of scope.
- **ADG-first**: Before W1, query ADG for `adg_nodes_by_file` on `apps_lic/__main__.py` to verify no new outbound edges to HOP agents or prompt strings are introduced.
- **Author-Gate**: P0 and P1.5 phases require Author-Gate approval for test scaffold designs (40 tests, hard assertions).
- **Recipe ownership clarity**: agentic_core owns protocol, apps_lic owns declarations/adapters, __main__.py owns neither.
- **Prompt Assembly ownership clarity**: Prompt Assembly owns compilation, L2 owns execution, provider gateway owns model invocation, Exit owns final disposition, UWG owns durable write admission.
- **Provider boundary enforcement**: All generation through governed gateway, no direct SDK calls.
- **Prompt boundary enforcement**: All prompts through registry-defined templates with real bodies, no placeholders, no ad hoc strings.
- **Durable write discipline**: Exit → UWG → L4 only, no direct L4 writes from L2 or apps_lic.

---

## Final Acceptance Statement

Entrypoint purity and recipe registry resolution are necessary but not sufficient. apps_lic is not spine-complete until its prompts are registry-defined, PromptBOM-bound, implemented as real template bodies, compiled by lic_pa_compiler into CompiledPromptArtifact, consumed by L2, enforced by the governed provider gateway, and covered by hard governance tests.
