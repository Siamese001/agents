# apps_repo_brief Deferred Scope Closeout — Implementation

> **Status:** Completed · **Tier:** T2 · **Slug:** `apps-repo-brief-closeout-impl-b3e7a2`
> **Source plan:** `apps-repo-brief-deferred-scope-closeout-a7d2f1` (deferred scope registry)
> **Purpose:** Implement DS-1 through DS-6 from the deferred scope registry, one wave at a time.

---

## Context

The deferred scope registry (`apps-repo-brief-deferred-scope-closeout-a7d2f1`) captures 8 items from Plans 3 & 4.
This plan implements 4 of them (DS-1, DS-4, DS-5, DS-6). DS-8 is already complete (verified 2026-05-05 — `apps_research/__main__.py` already has `_maybe_run_exit_hook` fully wired). DS-2, DS-3, DS-7 are deferred to a separate plan.

## Wave Structure

| Wave | Phase IDs | Focus | Est. Tokens | Status | Success Criteria |
|------|-----------|-------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| W1 | W1.1–W1.2 | DS-4: `apps_underwriting_ai` plan doc + Notion status sync | ~1k | ✅ DONE | Plan wave table all ✅ DONE; Notion page Completed |
| W2 | W2.1–W2.3 | DS-5: 7 P0 ADG layer violations remediation | ~8k | ✅ DONE | Zero P0 violations in ADG; all 7 files fixed |
| W3 | W3.1–W3.3 | DS-6: `apps_underwriting_ai` spine allowlist burndown | ~6k | ✅ DONE | Allowlist entry removed; spine delegation gate passes |
| W4 | W4.1–W4.3 | DS-1: `apps_repo_brief` FEC producer live wiring + tests | ~6k | ✅ DONE | FEC producer not retired; `__main__.py` cert hook; 7 tests pass |

## Non-Goals

- DS-2 (`apps_repo_brief` C0 runtime wiring) — separate plan
- DS-3 (`apps_repo_brief` L3 workflow adapter) — separate plan
- DS-7 (`apps_eval` phase 2 items) — separate plan
- No changes to `agentic_core` core routing logic
