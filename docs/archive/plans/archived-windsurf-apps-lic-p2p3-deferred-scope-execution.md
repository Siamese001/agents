# apps_lic P2/P3 Deferred Scope Execution Plan

> **Status**: `Not Started` in Notion (created 2026-05-05)
> **Unblocked by**: [apps-lic-infra-prerequisites-unblock-p2p3](https://www.notion.so/apps-lic-infra-prerequisites-unblock-p2p3-35727693f55c81e5b930fbde92aad535) — W1-W6 COMPLETE
> **Notion Page**: [apps-lic-p2p3-deferred-scope-execution](https://www.notion.so/apps-lic-p2p3-deferred-scope-execution-35727693f55c81a9be6af8fffbf989d4)

## 1. Executive Summary

This plan executes the deferred P2/P3 scope for apps_lic that was blocked pending infrastructure completion. All 5 infrastructure blockers have been resolved:

| Blocker | Status | Infrastructure Delivered |
|---------|--------|--------------------------|
| #1 L4 Touch State Persistence | ✅ | `apps_lic_touch_state.sql`, `TouchStateUWGAdapter`, registration |
| #2 Coordination Fabric Scheduled Wake | ✅ | `TouchScheduler`, `WakeHandler`, cadence calculator |
| #3 L5 HITL Re-engagement Policy | ✅ | `ReengagementHITLPolicy` with 6 rules, evaluator, escalation |
| #4 C0 FEC Binding (Research Bridge) | ✅ | `produce_fec()` with forward-compat for C0 retrieval |
| #5 Cross-Touch Identity Propagation | ✅ | `IdentityPropagationService`, `ContextCarryForwardBridge` |

**Execution is now unblocked.**

---

## 2. Goals

### Primary Goal
Execute all deferred P2/P3 scope items to enable full apps_lic multi-touch functionality.

### Secondary Goals
- Verify all infrastructure components integrate correctly
- Complete E2E test coverage
- Execute migration scripts for existing campaigns
- Enable research bridge integration

---

## 3. Non-Goals

- Infrastructure development (W1-W6 complete)
- New blockers or scope expansion
- Breaking changes to existing functionality
- Production deployment (separate release plan)

|----------|-------|---------------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| W5.P1 | Existing Campaign Inventory | `apps_lic/migrations/` | Data audit, compatibility check | ~500 | ⏳ |

## 6. Gap Register

| ID | Gap | Impact | Owner | Resolution Target |
|----|-----|--------|-------|-------------------|
| G1 | C0 retrieval sources not yet populated | FEC stays template-only | C0 team | W4 completion |
| G2 | Redis coordination fabric requires production config | Scheduling may fail | Infra team | W5 completion |
| G3 | Identity service L4 storage needs schema migration | Context loss on restart | L4 team | W5 completion |

---

## 7. Dependencies & Blockers

### External Dependencies
- C0 retrieval service availability (for W4)
- Redis production configuration (for W2-W3)
- HITL approval workflow configuration (for W1-W2)

### Internal Dependencies
- W1 must complete before W2 (P2 features enable P3 sequences)
- W5 migration depends on W2-W4 being stable
- W6 verification depends on all prior waves

---

## 8. Risk Register

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| C0 retrieval delays | Medium | High | Template-only path is functional fallback |
| Migration data loss | Low | Critical | Full backup, dry-run, rollback procedures |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Medium | Load testing in W6, feature flags for rollback |

---

## 9. Success Criteria

- [ ] 3+ touch sequences execute end-to-end
- [ ] Resurfacing triggers fire on signal detection
