# Orphan Agent Integration - Phased Implementation Plan

This plan breaks down the orphan agent integration into 4 phases with specific sub-phases to maximize success and minimize risk, ensuring each orphan agent is properly integrated into the existing validation infrastructure.

## Wave Structure

| Waves | Metric | Scope | Checkpoint | Tokens |
|-------|--------|-------|------------|---------|
| Wave 1 | Analysis & Discovery | Review current state | A | 25,000 🟢 |
| Wave 2 | Implementation | Core changes | B | 50,000 🟢 |
| Wave 3 | Testing & Validation | Verify changes | C | 30,000 🟢 |
| Wave 4 | Documentation & Cleanup | Finalize | D | 15,000 🟢 |

**Total: 120,000 tokens across 4 waves, all GREEN**

## Phase 1: Foundation & Validation (Week 1)

### Sub-Phase 1.1: Create Integration Infrastructure
- Create `red_team_integration.py` with AdversarialValidator and BoundaryValidator adapters
- Create `chaos_healing_integration.py` with ChaosResilienceStrategy adapter
- Create `dependency_healing_integration.py` with DependencyPruningStrategy adapter
- Create `register_all_validators.py` unified entry point
- Add comprehensive unit tests for each adapter

### Sub-Phase 1.2: Guardian Test Integration
- Update `test_orphan_agent_detection.py` to verify integration status
- Add tests to ensure registered agents are callable
- Verify no orphan agents remain after integration
- Update orphan disposition logic to mark integrated agents as "INTEGRATED"

### Sub-Phase 1.3: CI/CD Integration
- Add integration test to GitHub Actions workflow
- Create pre-release validation pipeline
- Add telemetry for validator/healing usage
- Create dashboard for integration status

## Phase 2: Red Team Security Integration (Week 2)

### Sub-Phase 2.1: Security Validator Registration
- Register AdversarialProbeAgent as "adversarial_probe" validator
- Register BoundaryTestingAgent as "boundary_testing" validator
- Register PromptInjectionAgent as "prompt_injection" validator
- Create RedTeamValidationSuite that runs all security validators

### Sub-Phase 2.2: Pre-Release Security Testing
- Add security validation to PR checks
- Create security report generation
- Add failure thresholds for security violations
- Integrate with existing CI/CD security scanning

### Sub-Phase 2.3: Security Dashboard
- Create security validation metrics dashboard
- Add trend analysis for security findings
- Create alerting for critical vulnerabilities
- Document security validation procedures

## Phase 3: Healing & Resilience Integration (Week 3)

### Sub-Phase 3.1: Healing Strategy Registration
- Register ChaosEngineeringAgent as "chaos_resilience" healing strategy
- Register DependencyPruningAgent as "dependency_pruning" healing strategy
- Create post-healing validation workflow
- Add resilience scoring system

### Sub-Phase 3.2: Pre-Commit Hook Integration
- Add PreCommitSovereignAgent to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Create pre-commit validation report
- Add bypass procedures for emergencies
- Test pre-commit hook performance impact

### Sub-Phase 3.3: Task Decomposition Integration
- Wire DecompositionOrchestratorAgent into NervousSystemAgent
- Create task decomposition API
- Add decomposition validation
- Create mission plan execution tracking

## Phase 4: Cleanup & Optimization (Week 4)

### Sub-Phase 4.1: Deprecation & Merging
- Deprecate HistorianAgent with proper deprecation markers
- Deprecate SemanticDebuggerAgent
- Merge CostGovernorAgent into BudgetGuardrailAgent
- Update agent discovery to reflect changes

### Sub-Phase 4.2: Documentation & Training
- Update architecture documentation with integration diagram
- Create integration guide for developers
- Create troubleshooting guide
- Record training videos for new validation workflows

### Sub-Phase 4.3: Performance & Monitoring
- Optimize validator/healing performance
- Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Create SLA for validation/healing response times
- Create rollback procedures for failed integrations

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success
- All integration adapters created and tested
- Guardian tests pass with 0 orphan agents
- CI/CD pipeline validates integration status

### Phase 2 Success
- All security validators registered and callable
- PR security validation working
- Security dashboard operational

### Phase 3 Success
- All healing strategies registered and callable
- Pre-commit hook functioning
- Task decomposition integrated

### Phase 4 Success
- All deprecated agents properly marked
- Documentation complete
- Performance meets SLA requirements

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Integration breaks existing validators
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite + feature flags
- **Risk**: Performance impact on CI/CD
- **Mitigation**: Parallel execution + caching

### Operational Risks
- **Risk**: Team resistance to new validation steps
- **Mitigation**: Gradual rollout + documentation
- **Risk**: False positives in security validation
- **Mitigation**: Tuning thresholds + exception handling

## Rollback Plan

Each phase includes rollback procedures:
- Phase 1: Disable integration modules
- Phase 2: Remove security validators from orchestrator
- Phase 3: Disable healing strategies and pre-commit hook
- Phase 4: Restore original agent files from backup

## Timeline & Dependencies

- **Week 1**: Foundation (no dependencies)
- **Week 2**: Security (depends on Phase 1)
- **Week 3**: Healing (depends on Phase 1-2)
- **Week 4**: Cleanup (depends on Phase 1-3)

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this phased plan
2. Assign owners for each phase
3. Set up tracking for success criteria
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation

## Rules

1. Follow all constitutional rules and guidelines
2. Maintain compliance with established standards
3. Document all changes and decisions
4. Validate all implementations before completion
