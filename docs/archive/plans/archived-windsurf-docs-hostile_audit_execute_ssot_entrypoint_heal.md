## Target: `python -m agentic_core.L0_routing.scripts.execute_ssot_entrypoint --heal`
## Date: 2026-03-09 | Auditor position: zero-trust, forensic-grade standard

---

## EXECUTIVE VERDICT

**NO. `execute_ssot_entrypoint --heal` cannot currently be trusted.**

This is not a marginal trust gap. It is a structural absence of forensic evidence. The system can and does claim success under all of the following conditions without producing verifiable proof:

- No mutations occurred
- Mutations occurred outside the write gateway
- Policy used is stale or hardcoded
- Post-heal validation was skipped
- An agent threw an exception that was swallowed
- Replay/scan mode was misidentified as commit mode in the summary

Every claim in the current output traces back to self-reported `fix_summary` strings and aggregated in-memory counters — none of which are independently verifiable from the artifact files alone.

---

# SECTION A — CURRENT TRUST FAILURES

## A1. HARDCODED POLICY HASH (CRITICAL)

**Location:** `execute_ssot.py:7466`
```python
_policy_hash = _h.sha256(b"sovereign-policy-v1.0").hexdigest()
```
**Verdict:** Every run on every machine at every point in time produces the exact same `policy_hash`. This is not a policy hash. It is a constant disguised as an audit signal. A run using a totally different policy config will show the identical hash. **This is a guaranteed false positive on every run.**

---

## A2. NO MUTATION LEDGER — ZERO PER-WRITE FORENSIC PROOF

**Location:** `agentic_core/L2_execution/tools/write_gateway.py:232`
```python
Logger.debug(f"[WriteGateway] write_text: {p}")
```
The gateway records nothing beyond a DEBUG log line. There is no:
- Per-write `before_hash`
- Per-write `after_hash`
- Per-write `trace_id` binding
- Per-write `replay_mode` flag
- Per-write `permitted` or `gateway_approval` result
- Append to any ledger file

**A human reading `heal_run_complete.json` cannot determine what was written, to which paths, in which sequence, or whether the gateway approved each write.** The only "proof" is an agent-supplied `fix_summary` string.

---

## A3. BYPASS PATHS AROUND THE WRITE GATEWAY

**Location:** Throughout agent code — many agents predate the gateway and use:
```python
path.write_text(...)       # direct Python
open(path, 'w').write(...) # direct Python
```
`_deny_writes_into_source_roots` is the only guard against these — and it is completely bypassed when `AGENTIC_ALLOW_MUTATION_FOR_TESTS == "1"` (set automatically when `--allow-protected-root-mutation` is passed). **There is no mechanism to detect, count, or report mutations that bypass `write_gateway.py`.**

---

## A4. NO PRE-VALIDATION PROOF ARTIFACT

**Location:** `execute_ssot.py:8053-8057`
```python
phase3_result = execute_phase3_validation(agents, territory, _phase1_violations, False)
```
`_phase1_violations` is computed during Phase 1 scan. The violations are:
- Used inline during heal
- **Never written to a structured `pre_validation.json` artifact**
- Not hash-stamped
- Not tied to the run's trace_id

The pre-heal violation state exists only in memory. If the run crashes or produces a partial output, the pre-heal state is unrecoverable.

---

## A5. NO POST-VALIDATION PROOF ARTIFACT

**Location:** `execute_ssot.py:8060-8064`
```python
if phase3_result["status"] == "clean":
    logger.info("✅ Phase 3: All files pass validation")
else:
    remaining_count = len(phase3_result.get("remaining_violations", []))
    logger.warning(f"⚠️ Phase 3: {remaining_count} issues detected")
```
`phase3_result` is computed but:
- **Never stored in `state_mgr`**
- **Never written to any output JSON**
- **Only emitted as a logger call**

The stdout transcript is not a proof artifact. A single `logger.info("✅ Phase 3: All files pass validation")` is trivially confused with a real pass. **Post-heal revalidation currently leaves zero durable evidence.**

---

## A6. TRACE_ID IS NOT THREADED THROUGH THE HEALING PIPELINE

**Location:** `execute_ssot.py:879-904` (manifest building) vs `_record_healing_action` (line 1335)
```python
# _record_healing_action schema:
action = {
    "agent": agent,
    "territory": territory,
    "fix_summary": fix_summary,   # self-reported
    "outcome": outcome,
    ...
    # NO trace_id field
    # NO plan_hash field
    # NO execution_mode field
}
```
The `trace_id` generated by `_v15_build_ssot_manifest()` is used only for the gateway audit log. It is not:
- Passed into any healing action record
- Stored in `heal_run_output.json` or `heal_run_complete.json`
- Used to cross-reference any artifact

**Two different runs' artifacts are indistinguishable by trace_id because no artifact contains it.**

---

## A7. SELF-REPORTED SUCCESS — NO INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION

**Location:** `execute_ssot.py:8112-8127`
```python
_record_healing_action(
    state_mgr,
    agent="FileClassificationHealerAgent",
    fix_summary=f"Fixed {healed} file classification violation(s) in {territory}",
    outcome="SUCCESS" if healed > 0 else "PARTIAL",
)
```
The agent determines its own `outcome`. There is no external verifier that:
- Reads the actual filesystem after the write
- Computes a post-write hash and compares to the claimed fix
- Validates that `healed` matches any filesystem diff

`healed = heal_result.get("violations_fixed", 0) if isinstance(heal_result, dict) else 0` — if `heal_result` returns `{}` (which it does on agent import failure, line 8104-8105), `healed = 0` and outcome = `"PARTIAL"`. This silently masks total agent failure as a partial success.

---

## A8. EXCEPTION SWALLOWING MASKS AGENT FAILURE IN SUCCESS SUMMARIES

**Location:** Throughout — example at `execute_ssot.py:8217`
```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"ObservabilityProbeExecutorAgent FAILED: {e}")
    state_mgr.complete_agent("ObservabilityProbeExecutorAgent", False, str(e))
    _record_healing_action(..., outcome="FAILED")
```
This specific case records `outcome="FAILED"` — but the Gate 1 (Agent Coverage) check uses `state_mgr.complete_agent(success=True/False)` which affects coverage ratio. An agent that throws is marked failed in coverage but its healing action outcome is `"FAILED"`, which is **not excluded from the success rate denominator** (only PARTIAL and SKIPPED are excluded). A run where every agent throws will show `success_rate = 0.0` — but the outer `overall_status` may still show `PASS` if no gate explicitly FAILs on this.

More critically: many call sites use `# guardian: allow-silent-swallower` and do NOT record a FAILED outcome — the exception is consumed with no trace in `healing_actions`.

---

## A9. NO EXECUTION MODE MARKER IN OUTPUT ARTIFACTS

The `HealContext.heal: bool` flag controls whether mutations are applied, but:
- It is **not written to any output JSON artifact**
- A scan-only run (`--validate`, no `--heal`) and a commit run (`--heal`) produce artifacts with identical schema
- The only distinction is a lower `violations_fixed` count — which is also `0` on a legitimate no-op commit run

A human reading `heal_run_complete.json` from a scan-only run cannot distinguish it from a commit run that healed nothing.

---

## A10. OBSERVABILITY PROBE RECORDS "SUCCESS" WITH ZERO MUTATIONS

**Location:** `execute_ssot.py:8187-8196`
```python
_record_healing_action(
    state_mgr,
    agent="ObservabilityProbeExecutorAgent",
    fix_summary=f"Observability probe scan: {len(conv_violations)} violation(s) in {territory}",
    outcome="SUCCESS",
)
```
This agent performs a **scan**, not a heal. It records `outcome="SUCCESS"` regardless of how many violations it finds. This entry flows into:
- Gate 1 (Agent Coverage) → counted as a covered agent
- Success rate denominator → counted as a SUCCESS

A scan that reports `N violations found` is semantically identical in the ledger to a healer that fixed `N violations`. Both show `outcome="SUCCESS"`.

---

## A11. STALE SNAPSHOT USE — NO CONFIG FRESHNESS PROOF

**Location:** `execute_ssot.py:7476`
```python
_config_hash = _hcs(_gcs())
```
`_gcs()` is `get_config_surface()` from `negative_control_harness`. This hash is computed but:
- Not stored in any artifact with a timestamp
- Not cross-referenced against a known-good baseline
- Silently falls back to a stable hash if import fails (line 7462-7464)

There is no mechanism to detect or reject a stale policy configuration loaded from a prior state.

---

## A12. NO RUN START/END TIMESTAMPS IN ARTIFACTS

`run_ts = datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()` is computed but `run_ts` and a corresponding `end_ts` are not written to any output artifact. Audit artifacts cannot be placed in chronological sequence relative to other system events.

---

## A13. `plan_hash` IS ABSENT — NO SURGICAL PLAN PROOF

The `SurgicalManifest` contains a `manifest_hash` computed as `sha256(ast_snippet.encode())` where `ast_snippet = "execute_ssot._legacy_main()"` — a hardcoded string. This is not a plan hash. No actual healing plan (territory set, agent set, violation set, operation set) is hashed and recorded.

---

## A14. `phase3_result` RE-USES `_phase1_violations` AS REFERENCE — CIRCULAR PROOF

**Location:** `execute_ssot.py:8053`
```python
phase3_result = execute_phase3_validation(agents, territory, _phase1_violations, False)
```
The post-heal validator runs against the same `_phase1_violations` list that was used to plan the heal. It does not independently re-scan the filesystem. If a healer claimed to fix violations by modifying `_phase1_violations` in memory, the post-heal check would show "clean" even if the filesystem was unchanged.

---

## A15. AGGREGATE SUCCESS MASKS PARTIAL FAILURE — "47 FIXES APPLIED" PATTERN

**Location:** `_write_heal_run_complete` — Gate 11 (Healing Effectiveness Rate)
`_total_fixed / _total_found` is an aggregate ratio. A run that healed 47 of 50 violations but left 3 unresolved in a critical path will show `93.4% effectiveness` — above the 50% threshold — despite 3 unresolved critical violations. There is no per-violation resolved/residual breakdown in any artifact.

---

# SECTION C — EVIDENCE CONTRACT UPGRADE

## Required Artifact Set (all bound by trace_id)

### C1. `run_manifest.json`
```json

**Derivation rule:** `overall_result` must be computed solely from `pre_validation.json`, `mutation_ledger.jsonl`, `post_validation.json`, and `decision_summary.json`. Any discrepancy between `overall_result` and the stdout transcript is a FAIL.

# SECTION D — FALSE POSITIVE TEST MATRIX

## D1. Healer claims success, no writes occurred

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Setup** | Agent `heal_repository()` returns `{"violations_fixed": 5}` but calls `path.write_text()` directly, bypassing write_gateway |
| **Trigger** | Run in commit mode; agent self-reports SUCCESS |
| **Expected FAIL condition** | `mutation_ledger.jsonl` has 0 entries; `before_hash == after_hash` for all paths; gate B7 fires |
| **Proof artifact** | `mutation_ledger.jsonl` empty + filesystem diff shows no changes |
| **Why it fools humans** | stdout shows "Fixed 5 classification violations" with green checkmark; no artifact contradicts it |

## D2. Writes occurred, post-validation skipped

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Setup** | `execute_phase3_validation` throws `ImportError`; exception is swallowed |
| **Trigger** | `phase3_result` is `None`; code path falls through to success summary |
| **Expected FAIL condition** | `post_validation.json` is absent; gate B5 fires |
| **Proof artifact** | Missing `post_validation.json` + `artifact_integrity.json` shows `present: false` |
| **Why it fools humans** | Healing actions show SUCCESS; no explicit error in stdout; green overall status |

## D3. Scan-mode run reported as committed repair

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Setup** | Run without `--heal`; `HealContext.heal=False` |
| **Trigger** | `fix_summary` from a scan agent contains "Fixed N violations" language |
| **Expected FAIL condition** | `run_manifest.json` `execution_mode=SCAN_ONLY`; gate B7 fires if repair language present without `mutation_ledger.jsonl` entries |
| **Proof artifact** | `mutation_ledger.jsonl` empty + `execution_mode=SCAN_ONLY` in run_manifest |
| **Why it fools humans** | `ObservabilityProbeExecutorAgent` records `outcome=SUCCESS` in scan mode; success rate gate shows PASS |

## D4. Partial repair, final status says success

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Setup** | 50 findings pre-heal; 47 fixed; 3 residual in a critical `L5_safety` territory |
| **Trigger** | Healing effectiveness gate: 47/50 = 94% ≥ 50% → PASS |
| **Expected FAIL condition** | Gate must evaluate residual findings by severity; any residual `severity=critical` findings = FAIL regardless of aggregate rate |
| **Proof artifact** | `post_validation.json` residual_findings list with severities |
| **Why it fools humans** | Aggregate 94% rate looks healthy; critical residuals buried in details |

## D5. Wrong snapshot loaded — findings disappear

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Setup** | `get_config_surface()` import fails; falls back to `sha256("determinism-digest:import-failed")` |
| **Trigger** | Pre-validation runs with fallback config; zero findings returned (different rules) |
| **Expected FAIL condition** | Gate B2: config_snapshot_hash matches fallback sentinel → HARD FAIL |
| **Proof artifact** | `run_manifest.json` config_snapshot_hash equals `sha256("determinism-digest:import-failed")` sentinel |
| **Why it fools humans** | Zero violations means all gates show N/A or PASS; summary appears clean |

## D6. Static `policy_hash` constant used (current production behavior)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Setup** | Current production code: `_policy_hash = sha256("sovereign-policy-v1.0")` |
| **Trigger** | Every run |
| **Expected FAIL condition** | Gate B7: policy_hash equals known static sentinel `9ab9b026...` → HARD FAIL |
| **Proof artifact** | `run_manifest.json` policy_hash checked against known-constant sentinel |
| **Why it fools humans** | policy_hash looks like a real SHA256; nothing in the output identifies it as a constant |

## D7. Mutation ledger missing one of several writes

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Setup** | Agent calls `write_gateway.write_text()` for 5 files; ledger append fails on file 3 due to I/O error; exception is swallowed |
| **Trigger** | Ledger has 4 entries; artifact integrity hash covers 4 entries |
| **Expected FAIL condition** | Cross-reference ledger entry count vs filesystem diff count; mismatch = HARD FAIL |
| **Proof artifact** | `git diff --name-only` count vs `mutation_ledger.jsonl` line count |
| **Why it fools humans** | healing_effectiveness shows 4/5 fixed; no indicator that one write is untracked |

## D8. Filesystem changed outside gateway

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Setup** | Agent uses `open(path, 'w')` directly; write succeeds; gateway never called |
| **Trigger** | `mutation_ledger.jsonl` has 0 entries for that path |
| **Expected FAIL condition** | Post-run filesystem diff includes paths not in mutation_ledger → HARD FAIL |
| **Proof artifact** | `git diff --name-only` output cross-referenced with ledger paths |
| **Why it fools humans** | Fix summary says "Fixed 1 violation"; it was real; but it was unauthorized |

## D9. stdout claims resolved, post_validation still has findings

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Setup** | Phase 3 revalidator runs against in-memory violation list that healer modified directly |
| **Trigger** | Filesystem still contains violations; in-memory list shows clean |
| **Expected FAIL condition** | post_validation.json re-run must use fresh filesystem scan, not in-memory reference |
| **Proof artifact** | `post_validation.json` timestamp must be after last ledger entry timestamp |
| **Why it fools humans** | logger.info("✅ Phase 3: All files pass validation") emitted from in-memory result |

## D10. Zero findings pre-heal, healer still reports healed

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Setup** | Pre-validation finds 0 violations; healer still executes |
| **Trigger** | Agent returns `{"violations_fixed": 0}`; records `outcome=PARTIAL` |
| **Expected FAIL condition** | Gate B7: commit mode + 0 pre-findings + 0 ledger entries + success claimed = HARD FAIL (silent no-op) |
| **Proof artifact** | `pre_validation.json` count=0 + `mutation_ledger.jsonl` count=0 + `execution_mode=COMMIT` |
| **Why it fools humans** | PARTIAL outcome is excluded from success rate denominator; effectively invisible |

## D11. Exception swallowed, final summary still green

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Setup** | Critical healer throws; `# guardian: allow-silent-swallower` catches it |
| **Trigger** | No `_record_healing_action` call with `outcome=FAILED` at some call sites |
| **Expected FAIL condition** | Any `guardian: allow-silent-swallower` in a healing code path that does NOT record FAILED outcome must force FAIL |
| **Proof artifact** | Exception audit: every swallowed exception must appear in a `exceptions_swallowed` field in `run_manifest.json` |
| **Why it fools humans** | Agent simply absent from healing_actions list; coverage gate may or may not catch it |

## D12. Corrupted artifact hash but decision_summary still PASS

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Setup** | `post_validation.json` written with truncated content; file present |
| **Trigger** | `artifact_integrity.json` hash of post_validation.json does not match recomputed hash |
| **Expected FAIL condition** | Integrity verification gate fires; overall_result forced to FAIL |
| **Proof artifact** | `artifact_integrity.json` with `integrity_verified: false` |
| **Why it fools humans** | File exists and is parseable; summary shows success; hash mismatch not visually obvious |

## D13. trace_id mismatch across artifacts

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Setup** | `run_manifest.json` written at run start with trace_id A; later artifacts written with trace_id B from a different run context |
| **Trigger** | trace_id correlation check fails |
| **Expected FAIL condition** | Any artifact with trace_id ≠ run_manifest.trace_id = HARD FAIL |
| **Proof artifact** | `artifact_integrity.json` includes trace_id consistency check |
| **Why it fools humans** | No current field in any artifact encodes trace_id; no check exists |

## D14. No-op patch with success wording

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Setup** | Healer writes file with identical content (`before_hash == after_hash`) |
| **Trigger** | write_gateway does not check for content equality before write |
| **Expected FAIL condition** | Ledger entry where `before_hash == after_hash` and `result=SUCCESS` → HARD FAIL on that entry |
| **Proof artifact** | `mutation_ledger.jsonl` entry with matching hashes flagged `no_op: true` |
| **Why it fools humans** | File modification timestamp updates; write appears real; content unchanged |

## D15. Same run produces inconsistent counts across artifacts

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Setup** | stdout says "47 fixes applied"; `mutation_ledger.jsonl` has 43 entries; `post_validation.json` shows 44 resolved |
| **Trigger** | Count cross-reference in `decision_summary.json` |
| **Expected FAIL condition** | Any count mismatch across stdout, ledger, and post_validation = HARD FAIL |
| **Proof artifact** | `decision_summary.json` includes cross-reference counts and fail_reasons list |
| **Why it fools humans** | Humans trust the largest or most visible number; discrepancy only visible on detailed comparison |

## D16. Duplicate findings collapsed incorrectly

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Setup** | Pre-validation emits 10 findings for the same file from two different validators |
| **Trigger** | Dedup logic collapses to 5 unique findings; healer addresses 5; post-validation shows 5 of 10 original violations resolved |
| **Expected FAIL condition** | Finding IDs must be validator-scoped: `{validator}:{path}:{rule}` to prevent cross-validator dedup |
| **Proof artifact** | `pre_validation.json` findings with composite IDs |
| **Why it fools humans** | Dedup appears to reduce noise; actually hides 5 unresolved violations |

# SECTION E — IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## E1. Inject `trace_id` into run_manifest and all artifacts (Observability layer)

| | |
|-|-|
| **File** | `agentic_core/L0_routing/scripts/execute_ssot.py` — `_legacy_main` entry |
| **Responsibility** | Generate trace_id at function entry (before any agent runs); pass to all phase functions and the write_gateway context |
| **Why** | No artifact can be correlated without a shared trace_id; currently absent from all artifacts |
| **Layer** | Observability / artifact layer |
| **Change size** | ~50 lines: generate UUID, thread through `HealContext`, write to run_manifest at start |

## E2. Replace hardcoded `policy_hash` constant (L0 routing layer)

| | |
|-|-|
| **File** | `execute_ssot.py:7466` |
| **Responsibility** | Hash the actual loaded policy JSON dict instead of the literal string `"sovereign-policy-v1.0"` |
| **Why** | Every run currently shows identical policy_hash regardless of actual policy |
| **Layer** | Runtime |
| **Change size** | 3 lines — load policy via existing API, serialize, hash |

## E3. Add mutation ledger to write_gateway (Gateway layer)

| | |
|-|-|
| **File** | `agentic_core/L2_execution/tools/write_gateway.py` |
| **Responsibility** | Before and after each write: capture `before_hash`, compute `after_hash`, append JSONL entry to ledger file; accept `trace_id` as optional kwarg threaded in from caller |
| **Why** | Currently zero per-write forensic evidence |
| **Layer** | Gateway / mutation proof |
| **Change size** | ~80 lines: `_append_ledger_entry()` helper; inject into `write_text`, `write_bytes`, `write_json`, `write_json_atomic`, `remove_file` |

## E4. Write `pre_validation.json` before any heal runs (Validator layer)

| | |
|-|-|
| **File** | `execute_ssot.py` — between Phase 1 scan and Phase 2 healing |
| **Responsibility** | Serialize `_phase1_violations` to `pre_validation.json` with trace_id, timestamp, validator provenance, normalized finding IDs |
| **Why** | Pre-heal state currently exists only in memory; unrecoverable on crash or partial run |
| **Layer** | Validator artifact |
| **Change size** | ~40 lines: `_write_pre_validation_artifact(violations, trace_id, validators_used)` |

## E5. Write `post_validation.json` after Phase 3 revalidation (Validator layer)

| | |
|-|-|
| **File** | `execute_ssot.py:8060-8064` — after `execute_phase3_validation` |
| **Responsibility** | Store `phase3_result` in structured JSON; compute resolved/residual/regression sets by cross-referencing `pre_validation.json` finding IDs |
| **Why** | Phase 3 results currently go only to logger; zero durable post-heal proof |
| **Layer** | Validator artifact |
| **Change size** | ~60 lines: `_write_post_validation_artifact(phase3_result, pre_validation_ids, trace_id)` |

## E6. Write `run_manifest.json` at run start and `decision_summary.json` at end (Artifact layer)

| | |
|-|-|
| **File** | `execute_ssot.py` — `_legacy_main` entry and exit |
| **Responsibility** | Write run_manifest at entry with all snapshot hashes; write decision_summary at exit derived from sub-artifacts only |
| **Why** | No run identity artifact exists; overall_result is currently computed from in-memory counters, not from artifacts |
| **Layer** | Observability / artifact |
| **Change size** | ~70 lines |

## E7. Write `artifact_integrity.json` as final step, print its hash to stdout (Artifact layer)

| | |
|-|-|
| **File** | `execute_ssot.py` — final step of `_legacy_main` before `sys.exit` |
| **Responsibility** | Hash all 6 artifacts; write integrity manifest; print SHA256 of integrity manifest to stdout as the single trusted output line |
| **Why** | No way to verify artifact completeness or detect post-hoc tampering |
| **Layer** | Artifact integrity |
| **Change size** | ~40 lines: `_write_artifact_integrity(artifact_paths, trace_id)` |

## E8. Add gate B7 false-positive circuit breakers to `_write_heal_run_complete` (Gate layer)

| | |
|-|-|
| **File** | `agentic_core/L0_routing/scripts/execute_ssot.py` — gate criteria block |
| **Responsibility** | Add explicit FAIL conditions for: static policy_hash, empty ledger in commit mode, missing post_validation.json, trace_id absent |
| **Why** | Current gates do not check for structural evidence presence |
| **Layer** | Gate / observability |
| **Change size** | ~30 lines per new gate |

## E9. Intercept direct filesystem writes in agents (Bypass detection)

| | |
|-|-|
| **File** | `ops_scripts/ci/check_anti_patterns.py` — add new pattern |
| **Responsibility** | Detect `path.write_text(`, `open(..., 'w')`, `.write_bytes(` outside `write_gateway.py`; fail pre-commit if found |
| **Why** | Agents that bypass write_gateway produce untracked mutations |
| **Layer** | CI enforcement |
| **Change size** | ~20 lines: new landmine pattern |

## E10. Add `execution_mode` field to `HealContext` and all output artifacts

| | |
|-|-|
| **File** | `execute_ssot.py:1379` — `HealContext` dataclass |
| **Responsibility** | Add `execution_mode: Literal["COMMIT", "SCAN_ONLY"]` field; write to run_manifest |
| **Why** | Scan-only and commit runs produce identical artifacts currently |
| **Layer** | Runtime |
| **Change size** | 5 lines |

# SECTION G — FINAL DELIVERABLE

## G1. Executive Verdict

**NO.** `execute_ssot_entrypoint --heal` cannot be trusted.

Not borderline. Not "needs tuning." The evidence contract is absent at the structural level. The system currently:
- Reports success from self-authored `fix_summary` strings with no independent verification
- Uses a hardcoded SHA256 constant as its "policy hash" on every run
- Produces no `pre_validation.json`, no `mutation_ledger.jsonl`, no `post_validation.json`
- Does not thread `trace_id` through any artifact
- Does not write `execution_mode` to any artifact
- Cannot distinguish a scan-only run from a commit run from artifacts alone
- Cannot detect mutations that bypass the write gateway

## G2. Ranked Risk List (False-Positive Risk Descending)

| Rank | Risk | Severity | Current State |
|------|------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | `policy_hash` is a hardcoded constant — same on every run | **CRITICAL** | In production now |
| 2 | No mutation ledger — zero per-write proof | **CRITICAL** | In production now |
| 3 | No `post_validation.json` — re-validation result goes only to logger | **CRITICAL** | In production now |
| 4 | No `pre_validation.json` — pre-heal state unrecoverable | **CRITICAL** | In production now |
| 5 | `trace_id` not in any artifact — cannot correlate artifacts | **CRITICAL** | In production now |
| 6 | `execution_mode` not in any artifact — scan/commit indistinguishable | **HIGH** | In production now |
| 7 | Agents bypass write_gateway with direct filesystem writes | **HIGH** | Detectable via CI |
| 8 | No-op success: `outcome=SUCCESS` when 0 writes occurred | **HIGH** | In production now |
| 9 | Phase 3 revalidation uses in-memory violations, not fresh filesystem scan | **HIGH** | In production now |
| 10 | Exception swallowing with no FAILED outcome record at some call sites | **HIGH** | In production now |
| 11 | `plan_hash` absent — no healing plan is hashed | **MEDIUM** | In production now |
| 12 | Aggregate effectiveness masks per-severity residuals | **MEDIUM** | Partially mitigated |
| 13 | `config_snapshot_hash` computed but not written to any artifact | **MEDIUM** | In production now |
| 14 | `run_start_utc`/`run_end_utc` absent from all artifacts | **MEDIUM** | In production now |
| 15 | `artifact_integrity.json` does not exist — no tamper detection | **MEDIUM** | In production now |

## G3. Hardened Gate Contract (Pass Conditions)

A run is **PASS** if and only if ALL of the following are true:

1. `run_manifest.json` exists with unique `trace_id`, non-sentinel `policy_hash`, `execution_mode`, start/end timestamps
2. `pre_validation.json` exists, contains the same `trace_id`, has findings with normalized IDs and validator provenance
3. If `execution_mode=COMMIT`: `mutation_ledger.jsonl` is non-empty OR `pre_validation.json` finding count = 0 AND gate B7 no-op check passes
4. Every ledger entry has `before_hash != after_hash` if `result=SUCCESS`
5. Every ledger entry has `gateway_approved=true`
6. `post_validation.json` exists with the same `trace_id` and a timestamp after the last ledger entry
7. `post_validation.json` shows 0 regressions
8. `decision_summary.json` `overall_result` matches computed result from sub-artifacts (not from stdout)
9. `artifact_integrity.json` exists and `integrity_verified=true` for all artifacts
10. `policy_hash` does not equal `sha256("sovereign-policy-v1.0")` (sentinel rejection)

## G4. Adversarial Test Matrix

See Section D — 16 adversarial test cases covering all false-positive vectors.

## G5. Implementation Plan Summary

See Section E — 10 surgical changes in priority order:

1. Thread `trace_id` through all artifacts (E1) — highest leverage
2. Fix hardcoded `policy_hash` (E2) — single line, critical
3. Add mutation ledger to write_gateway (E3) — core evidence
4. Write `pre_validation.json` (E4) — pre-heal proof
5. Write `post_validation.json` (E5) — post-heal proof
6. Write `run_manifest.json` + `decision_summary.json` (E6)
7. Write `artifact_integrity.json` (E7)
8. Add circuit-breaker gates (E8)
9. CI landmine for direct filesystem writes (E9)
10. Add `execution_mode` to `HealContext` (E10)

## G6. Acceptance Suite

See Section F — 8 acceptance tests covering: forensic artifact presence, scan/commit mode distinction, failed heal residuals, no-op prevention, artifact integrity, trace correlation, stale policy rejection, and out-of-gateway mutation detection.

## G7. Condition Under Which Trust Can Be Restored

Trust is restored when **all of the following are verifiable from artifacts alone**, without reading stdout, without trusting agent-supplied `fix_summary` strings, and without human judgment:

1. The run's `trace_id` is unique and appears in every artifact
2. The `policy_hash` is derived from the actual loaded policy JSON at runtime
3. `pre_validation.json` shows what violations existed before any mutation
4. `mutation_ledger.jsonl` shows every write with before/after hashes and gateway approval
5. `post_validation.json` shows the resolved/residual/regression breakdown after mutation
6. `artifact_integrity.json` verifies that none of the above were modified after the run
7. `decision_summary.json` derives `overall_result` solely from sub-artifacts, not from memory counters

Until all 7 conditions are met for a given run, the run's result is **UNVERIFIED** and must be treated as a potential false positive.

## Rules

1. Follow all constitutional rules and guidelines
2. Maintain compliance with established standards
3. Document all changes and decisions
4. Validate all implementations before completion
