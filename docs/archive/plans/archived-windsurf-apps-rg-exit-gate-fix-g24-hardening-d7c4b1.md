# apps_rg Exit Gate Fix — G24 Hardening + G28 Two-Pass + G22 Factual Grounding Diagnostics

Harden the G24 provenance gate, complete G28 two-pass audit-ref wiring, add G22 `factual_grounding` claim-level diagnostics, and fix the `GenerationMode` enum serialization bug that suppressed the HEADER SECTION instruction in PA. Also fixes the U0 `_resolve_text` fail-closed behavior for missing JD file refs.

---

## Context (SCQA)

- **Situation** — Multiple exit gate gaps discovered across two Brown & Brown live runs. W1–W2 closed G24. W3 wired `SealedWorkflowPackage`, two-pass G28, and gate verdict writeback. W4 fixed U0 JD ingress and PA `GenerationMode` enum serialization. A third live run (W4 validation) now shows G22 hard-failing at `factual_grounding=0.908 < 0.950`, and G28 pass-1 FAIL persisting in `07_gate_receipt.json` despite post-mesh WARN. The G22 scorer produces no claim-level diagnostics, making the 0.908 score unexplainable.

- **Complication** — (1) `compute_factual_grounding()` returns only a float; no `supported_tokens` / `unsupported_tokens` are persisted — making it impossible to distinguish paraphrase misses from real fabrication. (2) `07_gate_receipt.json` is written before post-mesh G28 evaluation, so the receipt always shows pass-1 G28 FAIL even when post-mesh upgrades to WARN. (3) The 0.950 threshold and the token-bag scorer are mismatched in design intent (exact extractive vs vocabulary overlap), but lowering the threshold is deferred.

- **Question** — How do we make G22 `factual_grounding` failures explainable, and ensure the gate receipt reflects the correct two-pass G28 audit chain without inventing fake refs?

- **Answer** — (W5.P8) Extend `compute_factual_grounding` to return a diagnostics object with per-token breakdown; persist into gate evidence and artifacts. (W5.P9) Move `07_gate_receipt.json` write to after post-mesh G28 so receipt includes both initial and post-mesh G28 verdicts; final X3 continues to use post-mesh result for authorization. Add 6 new tests covering both changes.

## Runtime Evidence

### W2.P3 — Brown & Brown run #1 (`rg-run-69746cc5f75a`, 2026-05-12T00:37:52Z)

`exit_status=success` · `outcome_authorized=True` · 36 s

| Gate | Result | Score | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| G21 | PASS | — | No FEC on this path; factual_grounding absent from dim scores |
| G22 | PASS | 1.0 | All 5 deterministic rubric dims = 1.0; `factual_grounding` not yet in scope |
| G24 | PASS | — | All 3 per-input hashes distinct from `evidence_digest` ✅ |
| G28 | UNKNOWN | — | Pre-wiring; 3 missing audit refs |

**G24 hash distinctness:** `jd_hash=034f5755…` ≠ `resume_hash=e5a1f258…` ≠ `target_role_spec_hash=e0e1cd1a…` ≠ `evidence_digest`

---

### W3.P7 / W4 — Brown & Brown run #3 (`rg-run-fc29b7ab9afe`, 2026-05-12T08:15:31Z)

`exit_status=blocked_denied` · `outcome_authorized=False`

| Gate | Result | Score | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| G21 | PASS | 1.0 | Schema valid |
| G22 | **FAIL (hard)** | — | `dim_below_threshold:factual_grounding:0.908<0.950` |
| G23 | PASS | — | |
| G24 | PASS | — | |
| G26 | PASS | — | |
| G28 pass-1 | **FAIL** | — | `missing_material_audit_ref:gate_mesh_result_ref`, `missing_material_audit_ref:decisive_reason` |
| G28 post-mesh | WARN | — | All material refs present; optional OTEL refs absent |
| G25, G27 | NOT_APPLICABLE | — | |

**U0:** `jd_text` length=4,321, `source_resume_text` length=10,132, `generation_mode=strategic_tailor` ✅  
**C0:** 2 evidence items (`jd:app_payload.jd_text`, `resume:app_payload.source_resume_text`) ✅  
**PA:** HEADER SECTION instruction present ✅ (fixed this run via `GenerationMode.value` patch)  
**L2:** `header` key present in generated resume ✅  
**Blocker:** G22 `factual_grounding=0.908 < 0.950` (hard fail) + G28 pass-1 FAIL in receipt (stale)

**Root cause of G28 pass-1 FAIL in receipt:** `07_gate_receipt.json` is written before Pass-2 evaluation; receipt always shows pass-1 G28 FAIL even after post-mesh upgrades to WARN. Addressed in W5.P9.

**Root cause of G22 FAIL:** Token-bag overlap scorer scores 0.908 against 0.950 threshold. No claim-level breakdown available — cannot distinguish paraphrase misses from fabrication. Addressed in W5.P8.

## Plan Closure (2026-05-12)

**Status: COMPLETED.** All waves done. W6 removed — superseded by apps_rg Golden State refactoring plan.

### P9 Canonical Closure Run

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Run ID | `rg-run-c68e95637652` |
| Target | Brown & Brown — SVP IT Strategy & Innovation (EXECUTIVE) |
| `x3_code` | `X3D_ALLOW_FINISH` |
| `outcome_authorized` | `true` |
| `hard_fail_count` | `0` |
| G21 header repair | `repaired=false` — LLM produced header; repair not needed |
| G28 post-mesh | `WARN` — allowed by exit policy |
| Closure artifacts | `artifacts/apps_rg/p9_closure_receipt.json`, `p9_closure_summary.md` |

### Architecture Classification

The `apps_rg_dispatch.py` FEC injection change in W5.P9 is classified as **LEGACY_SHIM_HARDENING inside `agentic_core`**. The repo is **not fully no-core-touch** — all apps_rg layer bindings (U0/C0/PA/L1/L2/Exit/dispatch) still live in `agentic_core`.

### Forward Reference

The remaining architectural work — moving all apps_rg bindings out of `agentic_core`, section-level generation, and section-level X1D scoring — is tracked in:

- **Golden State backlog:** `artifacts/apps_rg/next_apps_rg_golden_state_backlog.md` (items GS-01 through GS-10)
- **New plan:** `apps-rg-golden-state-section-generation-<hex>.md` (to be created)
