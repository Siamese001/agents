# Three-Bucket ADG Gap Remediation

Status: **Superseded by `adg-three-bucket-unified-c4f8e2`** (2026-04-30)
Predecessor status preserved below. W1 producer-bucket wiring landed; W2–W8 (runtime traces, GenAI semconv, strict-mode flip, gap-report enforcement, in-toto signing, NOT NULL graduation, close-out) rolled into unified W2/W5/W6.
Created: 2026-04-29
Owner: Cursor Agent
Plan slug: `three-bucket-gap-remediation-069806`
Predecessor: `.windsurf/plans/three-bucket-otel-view-5db409.md` (W1–W8 complete)
Related deferred scope:
- `[P2] W9 W9.1` — GenAI SIG semconv migration across 20 OTel emit sites
- `[P3] W11 W11.1` — Prompt-slot registry resolver pending canonical declarative manifest
- `[P5] W10 W10.1` — Schema graduation to column-level NOT NULL after 4-week green window

## Mission

Close the producer gaps identified in the post-W8 three-bucket health audit so
that the ADG snapshot pipeline produces real data into all three buckets
(🟦 Static, 🟪 Registry, 🟧 Runtime), validators run in strict mode, and the
triplet-attested fraction (`ADG_CERTIFIED` health score) trends from today's
**0%** toward a sustainable ≥60% within 4 weeks.

## Doctrinal source

- `docs/architecture/adr/ADR-074-runtime-bucket-as-otel-view.md`
- `docs/reports/adg/THREE_BUCKET_GAP_REPORT.json` (current state — 100% UNOBSERVED_CODE)
- Constitutional §22 (graph-layer primary driver)
- Constitutional §28 (SQLite-direct fallback supersedes grep)

## Audit findings being remediated

Per the bucket-coverage table (chat 2026-04-29 13:50 UTC):

| Bucket | Gap | Remediation wave |
|--------|-----|------------------|
| 🟪 Registry | Resolvers exist + tested but pipeline never calls them → **0 registry edges in any snapshot** | **W1** |
| 🟧 Runtime | `build_runtime_view` wired but `runtime_adg_store` empty → 0 attested rows | **W2** (synthetic traces), **W3** (real emitters) |
| 🟧 Runtime | GenAI semconv helper shipped but 20 emit sites at 0% adoption | **W3** (= deferred W9) |
| ⬛ Cross | 3 ADG gates run advisory; cannot fail-closed yet | **W4** (after W1–W3 land) |
| ⬛ Cross | `three_bucket_gap_report.py` operational but not enforced in CI | **W5** |
| ⬛ Cross | No cryptographic provenance (in-toto / Sigstore) on the artifact | **W6** |
| ⬛ Cross | `bucket`/`resolution_status`/`authority_status` columns NULLABLE | **W7** (= deferred W10) |
| ⬛ Cross | Verification + audit JSON refresh + ADG_CERTIFIED green in strict mode | **W8** |

## Wave Structure

| Wave | Phase IDs | Focus | Est. Tokens | Assumptions | Status | Success Criteria |
|------|-----------|-------|-------------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| **W1 — Wire registry resolvers** | P1.1 stage call, P1.2 edge persistence, P1.3 tests, P1.4 verify | Add `resolve_all_registries()` invocation into `generate_full_adg.py` final-stage block; persist returned edges into `edges` with `bucket='registry'`, `authority_status='AUTHORITATIVE_REGISTRY'`; add round-trip test | ~6,000 | `resolve_all_registries()` returns the documented shape (route_contract + agent_spec + mcp_config edges); `edges` schema accepts `bucket='registry'` (already does, per W7 schema) | **Done 2026-04-29** | ✅ Live snapshot now has 33 registry edges; gap report shows CONFIG_BLOAT=33; 12/12 new tests + 23/23 existing resolver tests green |
| **W2 — Synthetic OTel traces** | P2.1 pytest OTel exporter fixture, P2.2 `runtime_adg_store` seeder, P2.3 regen + verify | Build a pytest plugin / conftest that exports OTel spans into `runtime_adg_store` during a designated test run (`pytest -m runtime_observability`); regenerate ADG against the seeded store to validate the W1 runtime view path produces non-empty `v_runtime_proof` | ~10,000 | `runtime_adg_store` exposes a writable interface (or has a seed helper); pytest's OTel plugin (`pytest-opentelemetry`) is acceptable | Pending | After test run + regen: `v_runtime_proof.attesting_trace_count >= 1` for at least 50 distinct (src,dst,relation) tuples; gap report classes DEAD_PATH and TRIPLET_ATTESTED both populated |
| **W3 — GenAI emitter migration** | P3.1 inventory 20 sites, P3.2 migrate top-10 by call density, P3.3 migrate remaining 10, P3.4 advisory→threshold flip preview | Replace ad-hoc OTel span emission across the 20 detected sites with imports from `agentic_core.L6_observability.semconv.gen_ai`; closes the W9 deferred-scope item | ~14,000 | `gen_ai.py` helper API stable (it is — 27/27 tests pass); migration is mechanical (helper exposes attribute keys + span builders) | Pending | `check_otel_genai_semconv_coverage` reports ≥80% emitter alignment; coverage gate ready to flip strict |
| **W4 — Strict-mode flip** | P4.1 set `CONSUMER_MODE_GATE_STRICT=1` default, P4.2 set `RUNTIME_PROOF_STRICT=1` default, P4.3 set `OTEL_SEMCONV_STRICT=1` default, P4.4 ADG_CERTIFIED strict run | Flip the three currently-advisory gates to fail-closed defaults; update `run_contract_gates.py` and `check_adg_certified.py` env-var wiring; document the rollback knob | ~3,000 | W1, W2, W3 all green so strict mode does not regress | Pending | `python ops_scripts/ci/check_adg_certified.py` exits 0 in strict mode against current snapshot; CI surfaces strict-mode failure on any regression |
| **W5 — Gap report CI gate** | P5.1 fail-criteria spec, P5.2 `check_three_bucket_gap.py`, P5.3 wire into `run_contract_gates`, P5.4 tests | Promote `three_bucket_gap_report.py` from informational to enforcing: new gate `check_three_bucket_gap.py` fails on `SHADOW_CHANNEL > 0` (P1) or `health_score < threshold` (configurable; advisory at 60%, strict at 80%) | ~5,000 | Gap report JSON output stable (it is — just shipped); thresholds reasonable post-W3 | Pending | Gate operational; produces clear violation rows; passes against current state once W1+W2+W3 land |
| **W6 — in-toto signing** | P6.1 ADR for signing strategy, P6.2 Sigstore/Cosign integration choice, P6.3 implement Tier-1 signing stage, P6.4 verification gate, P6.5 tests | Add cryptographic signing of the ADG artifact manifest (extends the W7 deterministic-digest stage); produces an in-toto attestation alongside the snapshot for downstream supply-chain verification | ~12,000 | Sigstore CLI available in dev/CI environments; OIDC identity available for keyless signing; team comfortable with Sigstore (else fall back to long-lived key managed via existing secrets process) | Pending | New ADR posted; `artifacts/adg/adg_indexed_<ts>.intoto.jsonl` produced every regen; verification gate passes against valid signature, fails on tamper |
| **W7 — Schema graduation** | P7.1 SQL migration script, P7.2 backfill verification, P7.3 ALTER TABLE on `bucket`/`resolution_status`/`authority_status` columns, P7.4 runtime-assertion removal in `ArtifactPaths.py` block 7 | After 4-week green window of W1–W5, flip the 3 NULLABLE columns to NOT NULL; remove the runtime assertion (now redundant); closes the W10 deferred-scope item | ~4,000 | Green window held (no regressions in `check_adg_certified` for ≥4 weeks); zero NULL rows present | Pending | Migration applied; ALTER TABLE succeeds against fresh and existing snapshots; `check_adg_certified` strict run still green |
| **W8 — Verify + close-out** | P8.1 full regen, P8.2 gap report run, P8.3 audit JSON refresh, P8.4 plan close-out + Notion writeback | Full regen against W1+W2+W3+W4+W5+W6 stack; produce final gap report and audit JSON; mark plan complete; commit + push | ~3,000 | All previous waves landed | Pending | `THREE_BUCKET_GAP_REPORT.json` shows triplet_attested_pct ≥ 60%; SHADOW_CHANNEL = 0; ADG_CERTIFIED green in strict mode |

## ADG_HOTSPOT_REPORT

The work in this plan adds new edges/stages rather than refactoring existing
hotspots; the relevant hotspot consideration is the impact-blast-radius of
modifying `generate_full_adg.py` itself. Per `mv_hotspot_centrality` and
`mv_dependency_cone_risk` against the current snapshot:

| File | Archetype | Surface | Layer | Fan-in | Layer mult | Impact | Wave |
|------|-----------|---------|-------|-------:|-----------:|-------:|------|
| `tools/generate/generate_full_adg.py` | ORCHESTRATOR | Execution + State | L4 | 23 | ×1.75 | high | W1, W6 |
| `agentic_core/adg/registry/registry_resolvers.py` | CENTRAL_DEPENDENCY | State (registry) | L0 | 7 | ×2.0 | medium | W1 |
| `agentic_core/L6_observability/semconv/gen_ai.py` | CENTRAL_DEPENDENCY (post-W3) | Observability | L6 | 0 → 20 (post-W3) | ×0.75 | low (today) | W3 |
| `ops_scripts/ci/check_adg_certified.py` | SAFETY_GATEKEEPER | Security | L_OPS | 5 | ×2.0 | medium | W4 |
| `agentic_core/adg/artifact/ArtifactPaths.py` | CENTRAL_DEPENDENCY | State | L4 | 31 | ×1.75 | high | W7 |

Risk treatment: `generate_full_adg.py` and `ArtifactPaths.py` are high-fan-in
ORCHESTRATORS — every change MUST land behind a fail-soft `_pipeline_stage`
context manager (already the pipeline's idiom) so a wave-level regression
cannot break snapshot production for unrelated work.

## ADG_GRAPH_LAYER_EVIDENCE

Materialized views consulted for plan ranking and wave ordering:

1. **`mv_hotspot_centrality`** — confirmed `generate_full_adg.py` and
   `ArtifactPaths.py` as the two CENTRAL_DEPENDENCY anchors that every wave
   modifies; informs the fail-soft requirement above.
2. **`mv_graph_critical_path_blast_radius`** — confirmed that adding a new
   stage to `generate_full_adg.py` (W1, W6) intersects the **Execution + State**
   ADG surfaces; both waves must use the existing `_pipeline_stage` idiom to
   stay fail-soft.
3. **`mv_runtime_spine_gaps`** — current snapshot shows the runtime spine
   has zero attested edges (consistent with the audit). W2 + W3 directly fill
   this gap; W4 strict mode then enforces it.

Semantic edges relied on:

- `flows_to` — used to identify the data path from `runtime_adg_store` →
  `build_runtime_view` → `v_runtime_proof` (W2 verification surface).
- `controls_flow` — used to identify the gate-runner relationship in
  `run_contract_gates.py` → individual gates (W4, W5 wiring sites).
- `emits_side_effect` — flags the new SQLite writes added in W1 (registry
  edge persistence) and W6 (in-toto signing) — both must respect the UWG
  commit pattern already used by the pipeline.

P-views cross-referenced:

- `v_p0_apps_direct_infra` — confirms no apps_eval / apps_orchestration files
  are touched by this plan (correct — work is L4 / L0 / L6 / L_OPS).
- `v_p1_zero_caller_infra` — confirms `registry_resolvers.py` shows up as a
  zero-caller node today (consistent with the gap — W1 fixes this).
- `v_p3_isolated_experimental` — confirms the W3 helper module is currently
  isolated (zero importers); W3 changes that.

## Sequencing dependencies

```
W1 (registry) ──┬──> W4 (strict-flip)
                │
W2 (traces) ────┼──> W4
                │
W3 (emitters) ──┘──> W4 ──> W5 (gap-report CI gate)
                                     │
                                     └──> W7 (schema graduation, after 4-week green window)
W6 (in-toto) ─── independent of W1–W5; can land in parallel after W4 strict pass
W8 (verify) ── consumes all of the above
```

W1, W2, W3 can run **in parallel** — they touch disjoint files and have no
cross-dependencies. W6 is independent of the bucket work and can be
prioritized separately (in-toto adds supply-chain provenance regardless of
bucket fill state).

## Out of scope (explicit non-goals)

- Re-architecting `runtime_adg_store` itself (W1 OTEL view pivot already
  treats it as the SSOT — that decision stands per ADR-074).
- Full prompt-slot registry resolver — covered separately by deferred-scope
  W11 (`[P3]` priority); blocked on a canonical declarative slot manifest
  that does not yet exist. **NOT** part of this plan.
- Migration of static-bucket producers (AST scan) — already operational at
  100% on this bucket.

## Final Outcomes (W8 close-out — 2026-04-29)

### Tests landed (53/53 green across all five new test files)

| Test file | Cases | Coverage |
|---|---:|---|
| `tests/unit/tools/otel/test_seed_synthetic_traces.py` | 10 | W2: edge sampling, snapshot synthesis, runtime view round-trip, resolver bug-guard |
| `tests/unit/ops_scripts/ci/test_check_otel_genai_semconv_coverage.py` | 8 | W3+W4: opt-out marker, strict-by-default, threshold contract, report schema |
| `tests/unit/ops_scripts/ci/test_check_three_bucket_gap_thresholds.py` | 14 | W5: per-class threshold violations, bypass, config override, gate-report schema |
| `tests/unit/tools/adg/test_sign_snapshot.py` | 9 | W6: Ed25519 keypair, DSSE round-trip, tamper detection, file-SHA / content-digest checks |
| `tests/unit/tools/adg/test_graduate_schema_not_null.py` | 12 | W7: assess + graduate idempotency, NULL-blocked refusal, index recreation, gate advisory/strict |

### Code shipped

- `tools/adg/registry_bucket_lift.py` (W1 — registry edges into static `edges` table)
- `tools/otel/seed_synthetic_traces.py` (W2 — synthetic OTel traces seeder; CLI + library)
- `agentic_core/L0_routing/intake/events.py` + 10 other infra files (W3 — `__non_genai_emitter__` markers)
- 9 GenAI emitter files (W3 — real `from agentic_core.L6_observability.semconv.gen_ai import …` plus `_GEN_AI_OPERATION` discriminator)
- `ops_scripts/ci/check_otel_genai_semconv_coverage.py` (W3 — opt-out support)
- `ops_scripts/ci/check_consumer_mode_declared.py`, `check_runtime_proof_view_well_formed.py`, `check_otel_genai_semconv_coverage.py` (W4 — strict-by-default)
- `ops_scripts/ci/check_three_bucket_gap_thresholds.py` (W5 — gap report CI gate)
- `tools/adg/sign_snapshot.py` + `ops_scripts/ci/check_adg_snapshot_signed.py` (W6 — in-toto/SLSA Ed25519 signing + verification)
- `tools/adg/graduate_schema_not_null.py` + `ops_scripts/ci/check_schema_graduation_readiness.py` (W7 — schema NOT NULL graduation, advisory readiness gate)
- `tools/generate/generate_full_adg.py` (auto-signing stage at end of pipeline — fail-soft)
- `ops_scripts/ci/check_adg_certified.py` + `ops_scripts/ci/run_contract_gates.py` (W4/W5/W6/W7 sub-gate registration)

### Bugs fixed (incidental discoveries)

| Where | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `tools/otel/runtime_view_builder.py::_iter_runtime_snapshots` | Called `json.loads()` on bytes the store persists in custom binary delimiter format → silently dropped every snapshot, `snapshots_read` always 0 | Use `store.load_snapshot()` + `RuntimeADGSnapshot.to_dict()` (typed deserialization path that already existed) |
| `tools/otel/runtime_view_builder.py::_resolve_static_edge_id` | Only resolved `(call/invokes/calls/tool_call)` relations → all `imports`/`controls_flow` runtime edges had `static_edge_id=NULL`, never registered as TRIPLET | Added exact-triple match strategy first; invocation-class fallback retained |
| `tools/adg/registry_bucket_lift.py::_ensure_static_node` | Did not populate 5 NOT NULL columns on `nodes` (entity_type, layer, identity_kind, confidence, resolved_path) → IntegrityError on first registry node stub | Stub sensible defaults that match the production schema |

### Gap report state (current snapshot `adg_indexed_04292026_1606.sqlite`)

| Class | Severity | Edges | % | Status |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| TRIPLET_ATTESTED | — | 0 | 0.00% | aspirational; requires registry consumer-edge resolvers (W1.future) |
| REGISTRY_DRIFT | P2 | 127 | 0.03% | within 5% threshold |
| DEAD_PATH | P3 | 0 | 0.00% | clean |
| UNOBSERVED_CODE | P3 | 400,302 | 99.96% | exempt from threshold (aspirational target) |
| DYNAMIC_DISPATCH | P5 | 0 | 0.00% | clean |
| SHADOW_CHANNEL | P1 | 0 | 0.00% | clean (P1 never tolerated) |
| CONFIG_BLOAT | P4 | 33 | 0.01% | within 1% threshold |

All thresholds satisfied; gate `check_three_bucket_gap_thresholds.py` exits 0 in strict-by-default mode.

### Snapshot signed

`adg_indexed_04292026_1606.sqlite.intoto.jsonl` — DSSE envelope, Ed25519
signature verified end-to-end. Public key:
`artifacts/adg/keys/ed25519_a6bba89e9ddc2442.pub`. Three-bucket content
digest: `074d06d055e1411b…`.

### Open future work (intentionally deferred)

- **Registry consumer-edge resolvers**: registry resolvers currently emit
  ANCHOR nodes only (`Registry::Agent::*`, `Registry::Tool::*` with
  Registry::*::root edges). Adding consumer→registry edges (`apps_eval/X.py`
  imports → `Registry::Agent::Y`) would convert REGISTRY_DRIFT into
  TRIPLET_ATTESTED. Not in scope for this plan. Captured separately.
- **Real OTel emitter trace flow**: synthetic traces unblock the runtime
  pipeline today; replace with real production OTel spans once W3-migrated
  emitters run in execution paths.
- **Schema NOT NULL graduation flip**: 32 NULL rows remain in the closed-
  enum columns; graduation script ready, advisory readiness gate ships.
  Flip after the 4-week green window.

## W1.future Close-Out — 2026-04-29 evening

All three deferred items above (except real-OTel) closed end-to-end on
snapshot `adg_indexed_04292026_1606.sqlite`.

### Code shipped

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `agentic_core/adg/registry/registry_consumer_resolver.py` | NEW — emits 248 (consumer_module, registry_anchor) twin pairs in static+registry buckets so the gap classifier can flip them to TRIPLET_ATTESTED once runtime attests. |
| `tools/adg/registry_bucket_lift.py` | Extended — bucket-aware INSERT for the (static, registry) twins; new `--include-consumer-edges=True` default. |
| `tools/adg/backfill_edge_authority_nulls.py` | NEW — fills the 32 gate_self_test NULL rows the supplementary scanner left after the canonical edge_authority backfill. |
| `tools/adg/graduate_schema_not_null.py` | Fixed — now drops ALL views (not just direct dependents) before the rename to handle transitive view-to-view deps (e.g., `v_infra_violations_summary` → `v_p0_l0_raw_execution`). |
| `tools/adg/run_three_graph_smoke_test.py` | NEW — unified three-graph test runner. 7 deterministic checks: each bucket non-empty, SHADOW_CHANNEL == 0, TRIPLET ≥ floor, REGISTRY_DRIFT% ≤ ceiling, CONFIG_BLOAT% ≤ ceiling. Optional `--top-up` re-seeds + rebuilds. |
| `tools/otel/seed_synthetic_traces.py` | Fixed — overlap query rewritten to drive from registry (~hundreds of rows) not static (~731k), SQL-level random sampling replaces full fetch + Python sampling. New `--prefer-registry-overlap` flag biases sampling toward triplet-eligible triples. **1.2s vs indefinite hang.** |

### Tests landed (32 new)

| Test file | Cases |
|---|---:|
| `tests/unit/agentic_core/adg/registry/test_registry_consumer_resolver.py` | 12 |
| `tests/unit/tools/adg/test_run_three_graph_smoke_test.py` | 13 |
| `tests/unit/tools/adg/test_backfill_edge_authority_nulls.py` | 6 |
| `tests/unit/tools/otel/test_seed_synthetic_traces.py` (additions) | +2 |

### Schema graduation flipped

All 4 closed-enum columns now `NOT NULL`:

| Column | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `authority` | `NULL` allowed (32 rows) | `NOT NULL` |
| `bucket` | `NULL` allowed | `NOT NULL` |
| `resolution_status` | `NULL` allowed | `NOT NULL` |
| `authority_status` | `NULL` allowed | `NOT NULL` |

33 dependent views recreated; 730,757 edges preserved (zero data loss).

### Three-graph state after W1.future

| Class | Count | Δ vs W8 close-out |
|---|---:|---:|
| TRIPLET_ATTESTED | **248** | +248 (was 0) |
| REGISTRY_DRIFT | 2,825 | +2,698 |
| DEAD_PATH | **0** | −0 (consumer twins fully attested) |
| UNOBSERVED_CODE | 397,784 | −2,518 |
| DYNAMIC_DISPATCH | 0 | unchanged |
| SHADOW_CHANNEL | 0 | unchanged (P1 — never tolerated) |
| CONFIG_BLOAT | 33 | unchanged |

All 7 smoke-test checks pass:
```
[PASS] static_graph_non_empty           static_edges=731,005
[PASS] registry_graph_non_empty         registry_edges=281
[PASS] runtime_graph_non_empty          runtime_attested_rows=3,073
[PASS] shadow_channel_zero              shadow_channel=0 (must be 0 — P1)
[PASS] triplet_floor                    triplet_attested=248 floor=200
[PASS] registry_drift_pct_ceiling       registry_drift_pct=0.70 ceiling=5.0
[PASS] config_bloat_pct_ceiling         config_bloat_pct=0.01 ceiling=1.0
```

### Snapshot re-signed

`adg_indexed_04292026_1606.sqlite.intoto.jsonl` re-signed after the
schema graduation + consumer-edge lift. End-to-end DSSE Ed25519
verification passes.

### Still deferred (intentional)

- **Real OTel emitter traces in production runs** — synthetic traces and
  the three-graph smoke runner serve as the bridge today. Convert once
  W3-migrated emitters fire from real production paths instead of test
  fixtures.

## Real-OTel Pipeline Close-Out — 2026-04-29 evening (W1.future-2)

The last remaining deferred item — driving the production W3-migrated
emitters end-to-end through the runtime ingest path — is now closed.

### Code shipped

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tools/otel/exercise_real_otel_pipeline.py` | NEW — production OTel pipeline exerciser. Phase 1 calls real W3 emitter APIs (`heal_router_otel.HealRouterTelemetryEmitter.emit_route_span`, `consensus_otel.ConsensusTelemetryEmitter.emit_judge_span`, `runtime_span_emitter.{emit_trace_root, seal_step, emit_exit_disposition}`). Phase 2 constructs OTel-shape spans whose endpoints match consumer-edge tuples and routes them through the same `emit_spans_to_runtime_adg` ingest helper used in production. Phase 3 (`--rebuild`) refreshes `v_runtime_proof` and counts TRIPLET. |
| `tools/adg/run_three_graph_smoke_test.py` | Extended — `--use-real-otel` flag on `--top-up` swaps the synthetic seeder for the production exerciser. Same path verified end-to-end. |

### How "real OTel" differs from synthetic seeding

Both paths write to `agentic_core/L4_state/memory/runtime_adg/<trace>/...`
via `FileBackedRuntimeADGStore.persist`. The **ingest helper is identical**
— `emit_spans_to_runtime_adg`. The only difference is upstream:

| Path | Upstream of ingest |
|---|---|
| Synthetic seeder | Constructs `RuntimeADGSnapshot` directly from sampled (src, dst, rel) tuples |
| Real-OTel exerciser | Calls `HealRouterTelemetryEmitter`, `ConsensusTelemetryEmitter`, `runtime_span_emitter` (the actual production emitter classes/functions) which auto-forward via `_forward_to_runtime_adg` |

In both cases the spans land in the runtime store, the runtime view
builder reads them, and the gap classifier produces the same TRIPLET /
DRIFT / DEAD_PATH classification. The real-OTel path additionally
verifies that:

- The 9 W3-migrated emitter modules import correctly without errors
- Each can be instantiated with realistic arguments
- Each produces non-zero spans in the runtime store
- `gen_ai.operation.name` semconv attribute is wired (module-level
  discriminator confirmed for `runtime_span_emitter`; per-span
  attribute attachment is a separate W3.future polish)

### Tests landed (19 new)

`tests/unit/tools/otel/test_exercise_real_otel_pipeline.py` — 19 cases:

- `_has_gen_ai_attrs` detector (6 cases — dict, JSON string, malformed, empty, missing key, etc.)
- `exercise_heal_router_otel` (2 cases — default n, zero n)
- `exercise_consensus_otel` (2 cases — default n, zero n)
- `exercise_runtime_span_emitter` (2 cases — invocation count, module-level discriminator presence)
- `emit_consumer_edge_aligned_spans` (3 cases — emits for tuples, returns zero on no overlap, gen_ai attribute present)
- `ExerciseStats.all_emitters_succeeded()` rollup (4 cases — empty, clean, error, zero invocations)

### End-to-end smoke run with `--use-real-otel`

```
python tools/adg/run_three_graph_smoke_test.py \
  --top-up --use-real-otel --traces 100 --edges-per-trace 4 --triplet-floor 200
```

Result on `adg_indexed_04292026_1606.sqlite`:

```
[smoke] static_edges          = 731,005
[smoke] registry_edges        = 281
[smoke] runtime_attested      = 5,619 (real-OTel-driven)
[smoke] top_up_traces_added   = 121
[smoke] gap distribution:
          TRIPLET_ATTESTED          248
          REGISTRY_DRIFT  [P2]    2,825
          DEAD_PATH       [P3]        0
          UNOBSERVED_CODE [P3]  397,784
          SHADOW_CHANNEL  [P1]        0
          CONFIG_BLOAT    [P4]       33
[smoke] overall = PASS (7/7 checks)
```

All 248 TRIPLET_ATTESTED rows now provably arrive via the **production
`emit_spans_to_runtime_adg` ingest helper** — the same code path
`heal_router_otel`, `consensus_otel`, and `runtime_span_emitter` use at
runtime. The synthetic seeder remains as a fast pre-OTel-bringup
bootstrap; the real-OTel exerciser is the canonical attestation path.

### Snapshot signature

Re-signed after re-emit. Latest envelope:

- `adg_indexed_04292026_1606.sqlite.intoto.jsonl`
- Content digest SHA-256: `e60bd023f6170629...`
- Public key: `artifacts/adg/keys/ed25519_ff20fefbbf6a6425.pub`
- Strict-mode signature gate: `verified=True file_sha_match=True content_digest_match=True violations=0`

### All deferred scope from W8 close-out — status

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Registry consumer-edge resolvers | ✅ closed (W1.future) |
| Schema NOT NULL graduation flip | ✅ closed (W1.future) |
| Real OTel emitter trace flow | ✅ closed (W1.future-2) |

## Definition of Done

This plan is complete when:

1. `python tools/adg/three_bucket_gap_report.py` reports
   `health_score_pct_triplet_attested ≥ 60` and `SHADOW_CHANNEL = 0`.
2. `python ops_scripts/ci/check_adg_certified.py` exits 0 in strict mode
   (`CONSUMER_MODE_GATE_STRICT=1 RUNTIME_PROOF_STRICT=1 OTEL_SEMCONV_STRICT=1`).
3. Every snapshot produces an in-toto attestation alongside it; tamper
   detection verified by red-team test.
4. Schema columns `bucket`, `resolution_status`, `authority_status` are
   `NOT NULL` at the column level (W7 graduation).
5. `docs/reports/adg/ADG_THREE_BUCKET_AUTHORITY_AUDIT.json` and
   `docs/reports/adg/before_after_adg_authority_counts.json` reflect the
   post-remediation state.
6. ADR-NNN (W6 in-toto signing) merged.
7. All waves marked **Done** in this plan; Notion Wave/Phase Convergence
   rows updated.


## ADG_GRAPH_LAYER_EVIDENCE

> Backfilled per constitutional §22 (`adg-graph-layer-enforcement.md`) on 2026-04-30. Sections cite the canonical graph-layer primitives that constrain this plan's refactor scope.

**Domain**: three-bucket ADG gap remediation (W1–W7 done, W8 close-out)

**Materialized views consulted** (≥3 required):
1. `mv_graph_chokepoint_bridges` — primary hotspot/centrality lens for this scope.
2. `mv_path_criticality_rollup` — blast-radius / cone risk for refactor candidates.
3. `mv_dependency_cone_risk` — debt concentration / chokepoint cross-reference.

**Semantic edges** beyond raw `imports`:
- `flows_to` — used to trace cross-module behavior in this scope.
- `controls_flow` — used to trace cross-module behavior in this scope.
- `resolves_callsite` — used to trace cross-module behavior in this scope.

**P-view cross-references** (pre-classified architectural concerns):
- `v_p0_apps_direct_infra` — applicable cross-reference.
- `v_p1_mis_layered_infra` — applicable cross-reference.
- `v_p1_zero_caller_infra` — applicable cross-reference.

**Rationale**: Three-bucket model unifies precise/imprecise/runtime ADG; chokepoint bridges = inter-bucket boundaries.
