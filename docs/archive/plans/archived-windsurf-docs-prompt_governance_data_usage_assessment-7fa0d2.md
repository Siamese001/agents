## Executive Summary

**Finding**: Prompt governance data from `data/prompt_governance/prompt_injections` is actively integrated into `agentic_core` but **NOT** pulled into prompts in `apps_*` folders.

## Evidence Found

### ✅ agentic_core - FULLY INTEGRATED

1. **Direct Source Reference**
   - File: `agentic_core/config/core/injection_layer_config.py`
   - Line 6: `SOURCE: data/prompt_governance/prompt_injections/Instructional_Injection_Enhanced_v5.md`

2. **Active Implementation Files**
   - `agentic_core/runtime/config/prompt_injection_loader_config.py` (588 lines)
     - Loads and applies injection patterns dynamically
     - Contains `PromptInjectionLoader` class with 30+ patterns
     - Implements semantic fencing and prompt assembly

   - `agentic_core/mixins/instructional_injection_mixin.py` (198 lines)
     - Provides all 30 instructional injection patterns to agents
     - Implements layer-specific injection methods
     - Used by agents for prompt enhancement

   - `agentic_core/prompt_governance/meta_prompts/INSTRUCTIONAL_INJECTION_PATTERNS.md`
     - Copy of source material for L1 cognition layer

3. **Active Usage in Code**
   - `agentic_core/L3_orchestration/engines/sub_atomic_engine_impl.py`
     - Imports: `from agentic_core.mixins.instructional_injection_mixin import get_instructional_injection_mixin`

   - `agentic_core/mixins/subatomic_testing_mixin.py`
     - Imports injection capabilities for testing

   - `agentic_core/config/core/injection_layer_config.py`
     - Contains hardcoded patterns from source file
     - Defines all 30 instructional patterns

### ❌ apps_* Folders - NOT INTEGRATED

1. **apps_lic**
   - No references to prompt injections
   - No references to instructional injections
   - No references to PromptInjectionLoader

2. **apps_rg**
   - No references to prompt injections
   - No references to instructional injections
   - No references to PromptInjectionLoader

3. **apps_shared**
   - Has `apps_shared/utils/instructional_layer.py` (899 lines)
     - Implements injection patterns but does NOT import from prompt governance data
     - Contains its own definitions of InstructionalLayer, InjectionPattern
     - No import statements referencing `data/prompt_governance/prompt_injections`

   - Has `apps_shared/utils/subatomic_hop.py` (946 lines)
     - Implements subatomic architecture but no injection integration
     - No imports from prompt governance data

## Key Technical Details

### In agentic_core:
- **30 Instructional Patterns** actively loaded and used
- **6 Layers**: Framing, Context, Reasoning, Tooling, Safety, Output
- **Dynamic Loading** via `PromptInjectionLoader` class
- **Mixin Pattern** for easy agent integration
- **Semantic Fencing** for prompt security

### In apps_*:
- **No Import Paths** from prompt governance data
- **Duplicate Implementations** in `apps_shared/utils/instructional_layer.py`
- **Missing Integration** despite having infrastructure

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Connect `apps_*` folders to central prompt governance data
2. **Architecture**: Remove duplicate implementations in `apps_shared`
3. **Integration**: Use `agentic_core.mixins.instructional_injection_mixin` in apps
4. **Governance**: Ensure single source of truth for prompt patterns

## Conclusion

The prompt governance system is **partially implemented** - fully functional in `agentic_core` but **disconnected from application layers** (`apps_*`). This creates a governance gap where application-level agents may not benefit from centralized prompt security and enhancement patterns.

## Rules

1. Follow all constitutional rules and guidelines
2. Maintain compliance with established standards
3. Document all changes and decisions
4. Validate all implementations before completion
