# Author-Gate Enforcement Deferred Scope — Implementation Complete

**Plan ID:** `author-gate-enforcement-deferred-scope-complete-d7f5e3`  
**Parent Plan:** `author-gate-enforcement-fix-c9d4e2` (Completed)  
**Status:** Completed  
**Created:** 2026-05-09

---

## Summary

All deferred scope items (G1-G4) from the Author-Gate Enforcement Fix have been implemented. This plan captures the completed work that was originally descoped from the main enforcement fix to preserve delivery velocity.

---

## Gap Register — All Completed

### G1: ADG Query Timeout Edge Cases ✅

**Implemented:** W1 — ADG Query Timeout and Retry

**Changes:**
- Added `_ADG_QUERY_TIMEOUT = 5.0` seconds constant
- Added `_ADG_MAX_RETRIES = 3` with exponential backoff
- Added `_adg_query_with_retry()` helper function
- Updated `_get_adg_fan_in()` with retry logic
- Updated `_get_layers_from_adg()` with retry logic
- Logs retry attempts and successes to violations

**Commit:** `46680b45cd`

**Tests:** 7 new tests in `TestADGRetry` class

---

### G2: Windows vs POSIX Path Matching ✅

**Implemented:** W2 — Windows Path Coverage

**Changes:**
- Enhanced `_is_sensitive_path()` to handle:
  - Absolute Windows paths with drive letters (e.g., `C:\path\file`)
  - Mixed `/` and `\` separators
  - Path segment matching (not just prefix)
  - Case-sensitive matching

**Commit:** `168c8e5c71`

**Tests:** 24 new tests in `TestWindowsPathCoverage` class
- Windows backslash paths for all sensitive patterns
- Mixed separator paths
- POSIX forward slash baseline
- Non-sensitive paths (negative cases)
- Edge cases: empty, single backslash, trailing slashes
- Case sensitivity
- Partial match rejection
- Deeply nested paths
- Relative path prefixes
- Absolute Windows paths (C:\, D:\)
- Pattern-specific edge cases

---

### G3: Concurrent ADG Writes Resilience ✅

**Implemented:** W3 — SQLite WAL Mode

**Changes:**
- Added `_enable_wal_mode()` helper in `generate_full_adg.py`
- Added `_sqlite_connect_with_wal()` helper
- Updated 3 connection points to use WAL mode:
  - `_build_structural_outputs_report()`
  - `_build_refactor_accelerator_report()`
  - Edge-authority backfill

**Commit:** `9db592ee06`

**Rationale:** WAL mode allows concurrent reads during ADG generation writes, preventing SQLITE_BUSY errors that Author-Gate retry logic would otherwise need to handle.

---

### G4: Test Isolation for ADG-Dependent Tests ✅

**Implemented:** W4 — MockADGBackend and Test Isolation

**Changes:**
- Added `MockADGBackend` class for deterministic testing
  - Supports all 5 ADG states: fresh, stale, missing, busy, error
  - Configurable fan_in_data, layer_data, blast_radius_data
  - Call counting for verification
  - Windows path normalization
- Added `TestMockADGBackend` class (8 tests)
- Added `TestADGIntegrationWithMock` class (4 tests)
- Added parametrized test for all 5 ADG states

**Commit:** `1ec56a3239`

**Total Tests:** 74 tests pass (17 new W4 tests)

---

## Implementation Summary

| Wave | Gap | Commit | Files Changed | Tests Added |
|------|-----|--------|---------------|-------------|
| W1 | G1 | 46680b45cd | pre_author_gate.py | 7 |
| W2 | G2 | 168c8e5c71 | pre_author_gate.py | 24 |
| W3 | G3 | 9db592ee06 | generate_full_adg.py | 0 (infrastructure) |
| W4 | G4 | 1ec56a3239 | test_pre_author_gate.py | 17 |

**Total:** 4 waves, 4 commits, 48 new tests, 74 total tests passing

---

## Test Results

```
pytest tests/unit/windsurf_scripts/test_pre_author_gate.py
==========================
74 passed, 5 warnings in 0.59s
```

**Self-Test:**
```
python .windsurf/scripts/pre_author_gate.py --self-test
[self-test] OK — 10 triggers, 5 bypass conditions
```

---

## Non-Goals (Preserved)

- No changes to core enforcement logic (already completed in parent plan)
- No new trigger types added
- No packet shape changes
- No runtime HITL changes
- No ledger schema changes

---

## Deferred Scope Complete

All G1-G4 gap items from the original deferred scope plan have been implemented and tested. The Author-Gate enforcement system now has:

1. **Robust ADG query handling** with timeout and retry
2. **Cross-platform path matching** for Windows and POSIX
3. **Concurrent access resilience** via SQLite WAL mode
4. **Comprehensive test isolation** via MockADGBackend

- **Sibling:** `author-gate-pipeline-hardening-d7e3f9` — Pipeline hardening (Completed)
- **Child:** None — All deferred scope implemented
