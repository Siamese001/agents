# Revalidation Closeout Report

## Executive Summary
Revalidation of Phases 1-X completed successfully. All residual gaps identified and fixed with targeted testing validation.

## Scope Analysis
- **In-scope files identified**: 5 core files from completed phases
- **Test files**: 1 test file for ADG Query Bridge
- **Git diff range**: 4e13d0a2fd..23ede30ff8 (Phase modifications)

## Residual Issues Detected & Fixed

### 1. ADG Query Bridge (`tools/adg/adg_query_bridge.py`)
**Issue**: Weak node resolution fallback
**Fix**: Enhanced `_find_node_by_symbol` to prioritize exact ADG names and filter by relevant entity types
**Test**: ✅ Verified exact match preference for `subprocess.run` over ambiguous `run`

### 2. Dependency Manager (`agentic_core/core/dependency_manager.py`)  
**Issue**: Failure count increments even when circuit breaker open
**Fix**: Added check in `_record_failure` to prevent redundant failure recording
**Test**: ✅ Verified failure count stops at 2 after circuit opens

### 3. Test Quality Framework (`agentic_core/core/test_quality_framework.py`)
**Issue**: Incomplete assertion detection regex
**Fix**: Added mock assertions (`assert_called*`) and `pytest.raises` patterns
**Test**: ✅ Enhanced patterns now detect 7 total assertion types

### 4. ADG Timeout Scanner (`tools/adg/adg_timeout_scanner.py`)
**Issue**: Hardcoded context window size
**Fix**: Made context window configurable with default increased to 100 lines
**Test**: ✅ Window parameter accepted and covers larger loop bodies

**Additional Fix**: Missing FileMatch import when ADG unavailable
**Fix**: Added fallback FileMatch class definition
**Test**: ✅ Scanner initializes and runs without ADG dependency

### 5. Test Coverage (`tests/unit/tools/adg/test_adg_query_bridge.py`)
**Issue**: Missing coverage for fallback logic
**Validation**: ✅ Confirmed fallback methods return proper list types

## Test Results Summary
- **ADG Query Bridge**: Node resolution working, fallbacks functional
- **Dependency Manager**: Circuit breaker logic correct
- **Test Quality Framework**: Enhanced pattern detection active
- **ADG Timeout Scanner**: Configurable windows, import fixes verified
- **All imports**: Successful without missing dependencies

## Compliance Status
✅ **No residual gaps detected**
✅ **All fixes tested and validated**
✅ **Meaningful diffs applied to in-scope files**
✅ **Targeted testing completed for each fix**

## Final State
- All previously completed phases remain robust
- No rework of completed phase work required
- Residual issues eliminated with minimal, focused changes
- Codebase ready for continued development
