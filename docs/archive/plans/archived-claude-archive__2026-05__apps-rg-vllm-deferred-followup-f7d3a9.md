# Deferred Scope — apps_rg Interactive Wizard + vLLM/Synthesis Cursor Agent Followups

**Slug**: `apps-rg-vllm-deferred-followup-f7d3a9`
**Status**: Completed (2026-05-06)
**Tier**: T2 (cross-cutting: code + behavioral rule + ops)
**Parent context**: Session 2026-05-06 — surfaced while shipping `apps-rg-interactive-wizard-a3e7c1` (Completed) and the apps_research synthesis cascade hardening (commit `c4970b6ddb`).

## Goal

Track and bound the deferred-scope items surfaced during the 2026-05-06 session covering apps_rg interactive wizard rollout and the apps_research Qwen→Gemini cascade. None of these are blocking; each represents a follow-on opportunity. **Do NOT implement** — this plan is for capture only.

## Wave Structure

| Wave | Focus | Status | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | Sibling-app interactive wizards | ✅ DONE (rescoped) | Original "6 apps × wizard" was wrong — only apps_rg has the pattern. Extracted helper to `apps_shared/cli/interactive_wizard.py`; refactored apps_rg to use it; 14 unit tests pass. Commit `d8275ea810`. |
| W2 | apps_rg/scripts/ stale cleanup | ✅ DONE (partial) | Deleted 52 stale `generated_resume_*.json` + added `.gitignore` entry. `company_research.json` (Blend360) and `job_description.json` deferred — referenced by 13+ code paths, requires refactor. Commit `70f4b2d0a0`. |
| W3 | Qwen Docker auto-restart-on-reboot | ✅ DONE | `docker update --restart unless-stopped local-qwen-vllm` applied; verified via `docker inspect`. Topology doc updated. Commit `e80a622f34`. |
| W4 | apps_research cascade OpenAI/Anthropic tiers | ⏭ SKIPPED | Per user direction: "keep apps_research to Gemini". Not implemented. |
| W5 | WSL2 legacy archive disposition | ✅ DONE | Deleted local-only `archives/wsl2_vllm_legacy_2026-05-06/` (gitignored, ~5.5KB); topology doc captures retired-path detail sufficiently. Commit `8c738bb70c`. |
| W6 | Always-on rule promotion | ⛔ BLOCKED → deferred | §33 budget gate FAIL: 51,793/51,200 bytes (593 over). Promotion would push further over. Blocked on always-on rule trim. Captured in follow-up plan. |

## Phase-Level Summary

| Phase ID | Title | Scope (files) | Pain Points | Est. Tokens | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1.1 | Sibling app wizards | 6 × `apps_*/__main__.py` + 6 × test files | Each app has different "mandatory inputs" — apps_underwriting_ai needs different inputs than apps_qna; design needs canonical helper module to avoid 6× duplication | ~2400 | Not Started |
| P2.1 | apps_rg/scripts cleanup | ~62 stale JSON artifacts | Distinguish historically-valuable evidence (preserve) vs noise (delete); archive folder vs delete decision | ~150 | Not Started |
| P3.1 | Qwen restart policy | `docker inspect` config + topology doc | `--restart unless-stopped` requires docker stop/rm/run cycle; preserve env vars + GPU mapping | ~200 | Not Started |
| P4.1 | LLM cascade extension | `apps_research/engines/company_brief_engine.py` + `.env.example` | Two new SDKs (openai, anthropic); shared cascade-iteration helper to reduce duplication; env vars `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | ~800 | Not Started |
| P5.1 | WSL2 archive disposition | `archives/wsl2_vllm_legacy_2026-05-06/` | Gitignored — either retire entirely or formalize; user choice | ~80 | Not Started |
| P6.1 | Rule always-on flip | `.cursor/rules/apps-rg-interactive-discipline.md` frontmatter | Requires §33 budget headroom; W1 must land first to make rule worth always-on cost | ~150 | Not Started |

## Files In Scope

**Code (W1)**:
- `apps_underwriting_ai/__main__.py`, `apps_qna/__main__.py`, `apps_rfp/__main__.py`, `apps_research/__main__.py`, `apps_lic/__main__.py`, `apps_exec/__main__.py`
- `apps_shared/cli/interactive_wizard.py` (new — canonical helper to avoid 6× duplication)

**Code (W2)**:
- `apps_rg/scripts/*.json` (audit + selective deletion)

**Code (W3)**:
- Docker config (no repo file change beyond `docs/architecture/qwen-vllm-topology.md`)

**Code (W4)**:
- `apps_research/engines/company_brief_engine.py`
- `.env.example`
- New: `apps_research/engines/_openai_synthesize.py`, `apps_research/engines/_anthropic_synthesize.py` (or inline)

**Code (W5)**:
- `archives/wsl2_vllm_legacy_2026-05-06/` (delete or move to `docs/architecture/historical/`)

**Code (W6)**:
- `.cursor/rules/apps-rg-interactive-discipline.md` (frontmatter only)

**Tests (W1)**:
- `tests/_apps_contract/test_apps_*_interactive_wizard.py` (one per app)

## Non-Goals

- Hook-based enforcement of the wizard discipline (rejected during initial design as too heuristic for single-app concerns; revisit only if sibling apps reveal pattern)
- Auto-detection of "user explicitly authorized" vs "Cursor Agent inferred" (NLP-hard; not a viable enforcement layer)
- Real LLM-judge implementations for the apps_eval-harness backlog (separate plan: see memory `5ba9ca42` — STILL DEFERRED list)
- C0 FEC producer wiring for grounded apps (separate plan, blocker #4 in apps_eval-harness audit)
- apps_underwriting_ai analyst attestation flip from `PROVENANCE_PENDING` → `VERIFIED_ANALYST_ATTESTED` (separate plan: requires qualified-owner sign-off; not Cursor Agent work)

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Each wave has a Notion row registered with Status, AI Summary, Plan File Path
- ✅ When implementation begins, plan-registration enforcement (§36) does not fire
- ✅ Hotspot ranking shows none of these touch L0/L5 critical layers (so no §22 ADG_GRAPH_LAYER_EVIDENCE blocker)
- ✅ Each wave is independently deployable (no cross-wave blocking dependencies except W6 → W1)

## ADG Graph Layer Evidence

Not required at this scope — capture-only plan. When any wave is activated, the activator's plan MUST add the `## ADG_GRAPH_LAYER_EVIDENCE` section per constitutional §22.

## Pattern Source

Same shape as `apps-rg-interactive-wizard-a3e7c1` (the parent plan). Same shape as `plan-location.md`, `ssot-folder-enforcement.md`, `mcp-serialization.md` (helper logic + conditional rule + durable test surface).

## Constitutional Cross-Reference

- §6 (Author-Gate for ambiguous decisions — sibling apps will face same wizard need)
- §18 (no hidden scope expansion — these are explicitly listed as deferred, not "while I'm here" creep)
- §22 (ADG_GRAPH_LAYER_EVIDENCE required when any wave activates)
- §24 (deferred-scope capture — this plan IS the capture artifact)
- §33 (W6 gated on always-on token budget)
- §36 (plan must be registered in Notion before wave starts)

## Notion Registration

- Database: Plans DB (`6aba34d9-4d0b-4f4c-b956-b2bdea541ca9`)
- Status: `Not Started` (option id `503df59f-85d4-4ac0-baae-e457d0354b6f`, gray)
- AI Summary: bullet-style per `notion-plans-taxonomy.md` invariant
- Exists On Disk: true
- Plan File Path: `.cursor/plans/apps-rg-vllm-deferred-followup-f7d3a9.md`
