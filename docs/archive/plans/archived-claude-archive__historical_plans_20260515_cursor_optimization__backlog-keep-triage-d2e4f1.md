# Backlog Triage — KEEP-bucket Wave Plan

Generated: 2026-05-02  ·  Status: Live

## Context

Companion to `bulk_flip_stale_drafts` (2026-05-02): of the 298 Draft rows in the Backlog Items DB, 89 were closed (commit-attested) and 54 retired (plan deleted). The remaining ~155 are triaged here.

## Wave Structure

| Wave | Phase IDs | Focus | Est. Tokens | Assumptions | Status | Success Criteria |
|---|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| W1 | A.1 | Annotate 7 time/dep-gated rows: stays Draft, recorded reason | 4000 | Rows have explicit gating language in Blocking Items | Live | All A-rows have Evidence stamped `[TRIAGE 2026-05-02] bucket=A` |
| W2 | B.1 | Annotate 3 BACKLOG/future-idea rows: stays Draft, recorded reason | 2000 | Rows tagged MCP-BACKLOG / NEXT·P* / FUTURE | Live | All B-rows stamped `bucket=B` |
| W3 | C.1 | Retire 22 soft-closure rows (work likely done, no commit attestation) | 4000 | Soft-match on 'implemented/complete/landed' without commit SHA; spot-check via audit log | Live | C-rows flipped to Retired with reason |
| W4 | D.1 | Surface 124 unblocked rows ranked by Impact Score for next-session pickup | 1000 | No mutation; ranking only | Live | Top-N table emitted in this plan |

## Phase-Level Summary

| Phase ID | Title | Scope (files) | Pain Points | Est. Tokens | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---|
| A.1 | Annotate gated Drafts | Notion Backlog Items DB (7 rows) | None — pure annotation | 4000 | Live |
| B.1 | Annotate BACKLOG-tagged Drafts | Notion Backlog Items DB (3 rows) | None — pure annotation | 2000 | Live |
| C.1 | Retire soft-closure Drafts | Notion Backlog Items DB (22 rows) | False-positive risk if 'complete' refers to phase title | 4000 | Live |
| D.1 | Rank unblocked work queue | Notion Backlog Items DB (124 rows) | None — read-only | 1000 | Live |
