# Windsurf deprecation to Cursor SSOT

Deprecate all active `.windsurf` workflow surfaces - plans, skills, workflows, rules, hooks, scripts, schemas, state, templates, reminders, indexes, and `AGENTS.md` references - so Cursor is the only active governance and agent workflow SSOT.

> **plan_id discipline:** `plan_id` = filename stem `windsurf-deprecation-cursor-ssot-b6e4a9`.

## Context (SCQA)

- **Situation** - Root `AGENTS.md` and Cursor governance now identify `.cursor/**` as the active SSOT for rules, skills, hooks, MCP routing, and plans.
- **Complication** - The repo still contains a large `.windsurf/**` tree and many active references to it. Initial inventory on 2026-06-07 found 958 `.windsurf` files: 544 plans, 165 scripts, 76 skills, 56 rules, 54 schemas, 32 state files, 25 workflows, 2 templates, 1 reminder, `hooks.json`, `mcp_config.json`, and `RULES_INDEX.md`. Repo-wide search also found runtime/config/test references to `.windsurf/schemas`, `.windsurf/scripts`, `.windsurf/plans`, and `.windsurf/rules`.
- **Question** - How do we deprecate Windsurf artifacts without breaking runtime schema loads, historical plan provenance, hook behavior, or governance CI?
- **Answer** - Execute an inventory-first, staged deprecation: freeze new `.windsurf` writes, migrate active runtime dependencies to Cursor or neutral repo locations, archive historical plans and docs, replace agent guidance with Cursor-only instructions, then add enforcement that blocks reintroduction except for explicitly approved historical archives.

## Deprecation Policy

### Active SSOT

| Surface | Active SSOT after this plan | Windsurf target state |
|---------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Agent guidance | `AGENTS.md` + `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | No active instruction role |
| Plans | `.cursor/plans/*.md` | Historical archive or deletion |
| Skills | `.cursor/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Deleted after gap check or archived as provenance |
| Workflows | `.cursor/skills/*` or documented tool procedure | Deleted after migration |
| Hooks | `.cursor/hooks.json` + `.cursor/hooks/**` | Deleted after coverage parity |
| MCP config | `.cursor/mcp.json` | Compatibility-only mirror or deleted |
| Schemas | `config/**`, `tools/**`, or package-local schema directory | Deleted after consumers migrate |
| Scripts | `tools/**` or `.cursor/hooks/**` | Deleted or compatibility wrapper removed |
| State | `artifacts/**`, DB, or generated cache ignored by git | Deleted or migrated |
| Rules index | `.cursor/RULES_INDEX.md` | Deleted |

### Retention Rules

- No `.windsurf` file may remain authoritative after W6.
- Any retained `.windsurf` path must be listed in the closeout receipt with owner, reason, expiry, and guard allowlist entry.
- Historical citations to old plans are allowed only when they are clearly labeled legacy provenance and do not instruct agents to execute from `.windsurf`.
- Runtime/test code must not load schemas, configs, or executable scripts from `.windsurf` after W2 unless a compatibility shim is explicitly time-boxed.
- The implementation must not bulk-delete before inventory and migration receipts exist.

## Initial Inventory Snapshot

Captured 2026-06-07 with `rg --files .windsurf` and a file-class count.

| Class | Count | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `.windsurf/plans` | 544 | Largest surface; includes active-looking historical plans and `_archive` subtrees |
| `.windsurf/scripts` | 165 | Several active references from tools and hook/audit code |
| `.windsurf/skills` | 76 | Includes MCP stubs, structured reasoning, testing, author-gate, graph analysis |
| `.windsurf/rules` | 56 | Cursor `.mdc` equivalents must be verified before deletion |
| `.windsurf/schemas` | 54 | Active runtime/test consumers found; migrate before deletion |
| `.windsurf/state` | 32 | Includes plan registration cache and marker/state files |
| `.windsurf/workflows` | 25 | Agent workflow procedures; migrate or retire |
| `.windsurf/templates` | 2 | Plan and skill templates |
| `.windsurf/reminders` | 1 | Historical reminder |
| Root `.windsurf` files | 3 | `hooks.json`, `mcp_config.json`, `RULES_INDEX.md` |

---

## Verification Commands

Run from repo root after each relevant wave.

```bash
python ops_scripts/ci/check_windsurf_deletion_readiness.py
python ops_scripts/ci/check_no_active_windsurf_changes.py
python ops_scripts/ci/check_mcp_sync_integrity.py
python ops_scripts/ci/check_mcp_editor_parity.py
python ops_scripts/ci/check_mcp_config_sovereignty.py
python ops_scripts/ci/check_skill_frontmatter.py
python .cursor/scripts/check_cursor_native_config.py
python .cursor/scripts/generate_rules_index.py --check
python ops_scripts/ci/check_plan_format_compliance.py --strict --paths .cursor/plans/windsurf-deprecation-cursor-ssot-b6e4a9.md
```

Focused tests are selected after W0 inventory, but must include all touched schema loaders, plan lifecycle code, hook dispatch code, and runtime consumers that previously read `.windsurf/**`.

```

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Root `AGENTS.md` no longer calls `.windsurf/rules` a filesystem SSOT or `.windsurf/mcp_config.json` an active mirror unless compatibility-only with expiry is explicitly documented.
- `.cursor/**` is the only active location for plans, rules, skills, hooks, and MCP procedure.
- No production code or tests require `.windsurf/schemas` or `.windsurf/scripts` as canonical inputs.
- New `.windsurf` workflow artifacts are blocked by CI or hook checks, except explicitly allowlisted archive/compatibility paths.
- Repo-wide search has no unclassified `.windsurf` references.
- Closeout receipt lists every migrated, archived, deleted, retained, and deferred artifact class.

---

## Out Of Scope

- Changing product behavior in `agentic_core`, `apps_rg`, or app packages except path migrations required to remove `.windsurf` dependencies.
- Rewriting historical plan content beyond relocation, citation updates, or archive headers.
- Deleting user or generated worktree changes unrelated to this deprecation effort.
- Notion bulk status reconciliation unless separately authorized after filesystem deprecation is complete.

---

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Runtime code loads `.windsurf/schemas` | W2 migrates schemas first and runs focused tests before deletion |
| Historical plan provenance is lost | W3 archives or preserves citations before removing executable plan status |
| Hooks lose coverage during rename | W4 requires hook parity receipt and focused hook tests |
| Search remains noisy because old comments cite `.windsurf/plans` | W3/W5 classify historical citations separately from active instructions |
| Compatibility mirror becomes permanent | W6 closeout requires owner, expiry, and allowlist entry for every retained path |

---

## Open Decisions

1. CLOSED - `.windsurf/mcp_config.json` was archived under `docs/archive/windsurf/legacy-tree` and removed from the live tree.
2. CLOSED - historical `.windsurf/plans` were preserved under `docs/archive/windsurf/legacy-tree/plans`; executable plan SSOT remains `.cursor/plans`.
3. CLOSED - schemas remain under `.cursor/schemas` for this deprecation pass, with consumers migrated away from `.windsurf/schemas`.
4. CLOSED - legacy Windsurf script behavior needed for provenance was copied to `.cursor/scripts/_legacy_windsurf`; active callers now use Cursor/archive paths.

---

## Closeout Receipt

| Class | Final State | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| Live `.windsurf/**` | DELETED | Removed after `check_windsurf_deletion_readiness.py` returned `deletion_safe: true` |
| Historical legacy tree | ARCHIVED | Preserved at `docs/archive/windsurf/legacy-tree` |
| Legacy scripts | COMPATIBILITY ARCHIVE | Preserved at `.cursor/scripts/_legacy_windsurf` for historical/provenance fallback only |
| Schemas | MIGRATED | Active consumers read `.cursor/schemas` |
| MCP config | MIGRATED | `.cursor/mcp.json` is the only active MCP SSOT |
| Plans | MIGRATED/ARCHIVED | `.cursor/plans` is executable SSOT; legacy plans are archive-only |
| Skills, rules, hooks, workflows | RETIRED | Cursor rules, skills, and hooks are active; legacy copies are archive-only |
| Enforcement | ACTIVE | `ops_scripts/ci/check_no_active_windsurf_changes.py` blocks staged active `.windsurf` workflow reintroduction |

Deferred external writeback: Notion Plans registration/status update could not be performed because the Notion MCP was not available in this Codex session.
