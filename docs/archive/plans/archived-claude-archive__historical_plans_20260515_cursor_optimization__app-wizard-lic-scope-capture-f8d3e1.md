# W4 Scope Capture — apps_lic Interactive Wizard

**Capture-only plan** — User will design later. This document scopes the work for implementing an interactive wizard in `apps_lic` similar to `apps_rg`'s pattern.

---

## Context (SCQA)

**Situation**: `apps_lic` currently has 9 optional CLI args (`--recipient-class`, `--channel`, `--outreach-mode`, `--manifest-id`, `--manifest-hash`, `--policy-hash`, `--blueprint-hash`, `--request-id`, `--artifact-dir`), all with empty-string defaults. Unlike `apps_rg`, there are no mandatory target inputs that risk cross-company contamination. The wizard pattern from `apps_rg` (commit `d613a5c18a`) established:
- TTY-only `_interactive_wizard()` prompting for 3 mandatory items
- `_interactive_*.json` file writes
- `_assert_artifact_matches_company()` cross-company guard
- `apps-rg-interactive-discipline.md` always-on rule (promoted W3)

**Complication**: `apps_lic` generates professional outreach drafts. Target recipient/context selection carries similar contamination risk if wrong inputs are auto-selected. The existing 9 optional args may need wizard-managed defaults to prevent stale/outdated context from silently poisoning outreach generation.

**Question**: How do we extend the `apps_rg` wizard pattern to `apps_lic` while accounting for its different input model (9 optional args vs 3 mandatory)?

**Answer**: Implement a TTY wizard for `apps_lic` that prompts for the high-leverage inputs (recipient_class, channel, outreach_mode, manifest selection) when stdin is a TTY and critical inputs are missing. Write to `apps_lic/scripts/_interactive_*.json` and add cross-contamination guard.

## Evidence Sources

| Source | Why needed | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `apps_rg/__main__.py` | Reference wizard implementation (`_interactive_wizard`, `_assert_artifact_matches_company`) | ✅ |
| `apps_rg/scripts/_interactive_*.json` | Output file pattern to mirror | ✅ |
| `apps_lic/__main__.py` | Target for wizard integration (lines 168-210 arg parser) | ✅ |
| `apps-rg-interactive-discipline.md` | Rule to extend scope to apps_lic | ✅ |
| ADG blast radius | Files to update when wizard lands | 🔲 (run at design time) |

## Wave Structure

| Wave | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|
| W1 | Design — mandatory vs optional input classification; wizard UX flow | ⏸ DEFERRED |
| W2 | Implementation — `_interactive_wizard()` in `apps_lic/__main__.py`, `_interactive_*.json` I/O | ⏸ DEFERRED |
| W3 | Guard — cross-contamination validation; discipline rule scope extension | ⏸ DEFERRED |
| W4 | Test — wizard contract tests; contamination guard tests | ⏸ DEFERRED |

**Status**: ⏸ CAPTURE-ONLY — User will design later

## Out Of Scope (Until Activated)

- Real implementation of wizard UI
- Cross-company guard logic
- File deletion (no stale files identified yet in `apps_lic/scripts/`)
- Sibling apps beyond apps_lic (apps_qna, apps_rfp, etc.)
- Recipe resolver changes
- Exit eval hook wiring

## Gap Register

**GAP-1: Input classification ambiguity**
- `apps_lic` has 9 optional args vs `apps_rg`'s 3 mandatory
- Unclear which args rise to "wizard mandatory" vs "stay optional with empty default"
- **Impact**: Wizard scope undefined; can't implement without design decision

**GAP-2: Target identity field undefined**
- `apps_rg` uses `company` field for cross-company guard
- `apps_lic` has no clear "company" or "recipient identity" field in current args
- **Impact**: Cross-contamination guard needs a target identity to validate against

**GAP-3: Manifest vs wizard interaction**
- `apps_lic` uses `--manifest-id` + `--manifest-hash` for preloaded context
- Wizard may overlap or conflict with manifest loading
- **Impact**: UX flow must resolve manifest vs interactive prompt precedence

---

## Preliminary Rules (Draft)

1. **Mandatory inputs TBD** — User will classify which of the 9 args become wizard-managed
2. **TTTY-only wizard** — Same pattern as apps_rg: `_interactive_wizard(args)` fires when stdin is TTY
3. **`_interactive_*.json` output** — Write to `apps_lic/scripts/_interactive_{recipient,context,manifest}.json`
4. **Cross-target guard** — Validate that loaded artifacts match the intended recipient/target
5. **Cascade discipline** — Extend or duplicate always-on rule to cover `apps_lic`

---

## Success Criteria (When Activated)

- [ ] Wizard prompts for classified mandatory inputs when TTY and missing
- [ ] `_interactive_*.json` files written and read as defaults
- [ ] Cross-target contamination guard prevents stale artifact poisoning
- [ ] Discipline rule blocks Cascade from pre-filling target flags
- [ ] All tests pass; no regressions in non-wizard paths

---

## Constitutional Cross-Reference

- §18 (no hidden scope expansion — captured here, not silently widened)
- §22 (ADG_GRAPH_LAYER_EVIDENCE required when activated)
- §24 (deferred-scope capture — this plan IS the capture artifact)
- §33 (always-on token budget — rule extension must fit)
- §36 (plan must be registered in Notion before activation)
