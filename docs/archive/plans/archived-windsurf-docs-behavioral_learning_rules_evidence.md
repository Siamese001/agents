## Phase: Behavioral Learning Ultra Diff Implementation

### Objective: Synthesize learnings from last 12 chats into .windsurfrules improvements

### Wave 1: Pattern Analysis

**Behavioral Patterns Identified:**
1. **Evidence Contradictions** - Wave 2.3 claimed "pre-commit passes" but actual output showed failures
2. **Scope Violations** - Phase 10 modified forbidden engine files, required Phase 11 remediation
3. **Hard-Coded Bypasses** - Phase 10 used reference_strings whitelist, losing enforcement value
4. **SSOT Location Violations** - Plans saved to C:\Users\amita\.windsurf\plans instead of docs/reports/plans/
5. **Post-Commit Integrity** - Multiple phases required remediation when evidence didn't match reality
6. **Test Isolation** - apps_rg collection errors blocked Phase 10 completion

### Wave 2: Rules Implementation

**Added Rules §35-§40:**

**§35 - Evidence Contradiction Zero Tolerance**
- All evidence claims MUST be verified with actual command outputs
- Any mismatch → IMMEDIATE FAIL
- Raw outputs required, no summaries

**§36 - Scope Decontamination Protocol**
- Pre-commit scope verification required
- Decontamination steps for unrelated files
- Scope expansion justification required

**§37 - Hard-Coded Bypass Prohibition**
- Forbidden: hard-coded whitelists in invariant tests
- Allowed: temporary bypasses with expiration dates + ticket refs
- AST-based detection must be primary mechanism

**§38 - Evidence File SSOT Compliance**
- All artifacts MUST go to docs/reports/plans/
- System guidance conflicts → IGNORE
- Path validation against PROJECT_ROOT_WHITELIST

**§39 - Post-Commit Verification Mandate**
- Required post-commit checks
- Evidence file must include post-commit status
- Failure protocol for discrepancies

**§40 - Test Impact Isolation**
- Test classification system
- Structural work can proceed with failing feature tests
- Collection errors documented but don't block governance

### Wave 3: Existing Rules Strengthening

**Enhanced §5A - Scope Budget Gate:**
- Added Scope Decontamination Protocol reference
- Added Scope Violation Tracking requirements
- Explicit failure conditions for decontamination

**Enhanced §16A - Evidence File Lock:**
- Added Evidence Verification Protocol
- Added Evidence Contradiction Detection
- Added Post-Commit Verification requirements

**Enhanced Phase Template:**
- Added SCOPE field requirement
- Added Pre-Execution Verification steps
- Added During Execution checks
- Added Post-Execution Verification
- Added forbidden pattern references

### Wave 4: Verification

**Rules Added:** 6 new rules (§35-§40)
**Rules Enhanced:** 3 existing rules (§5A, §16A, Phase Template)
**Total Lines Added:** ~180 lines of behavioral governance

**Cross-References:**
- §35 references §16A for evidence verification
- §36 references §5A for scope decontamination
- §39 references §35 for post-commit evidence
- Phase template references all new rules

### Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Evidence Contradiction Prevention**: §35 mandates raw output verification
✅ **Scope Decontamination Discipline**: §36 provides explicit protocol
✅ **Hard-Coded Bypass Prevention**: §37 prohibits permanent whitelists
✅ **SSOT Location Compliance**: §38 enforces docs/reports/plans/ location
✅ **Post-Commit Verification**: §39 requires post-commit status
✅ **Test Isolation**: §40 separates structural from feature test failures

### Implementation Status

**Files Modified:**
- `.windsurfrules` - Added 180+ lines of behavioral governance
- `docs/reports/plans/behavioral_learning_rules_evidence.md` - This evidence file

**Rules Coverage:**
- Evidence integrity: §35, §16A enhanced
- Scope discipline: §36, §5A enhanced
- Bypass prevention: §37
- Location compliance: §38
- Verification discipline: §39
- Test isolation: §40

### Behavioral Impact

**Prevents Future Occurrences Of:**
- Evidence contradictions like Wave 2.3
- Scope violations like Phase 10
- Hard-coded bypasses in invariants
- Plans in external directories
- Post-commit evidence mismatches
- Test failures blocking structural work

**Enforces:**
- Raw output verification for all claims
- Scope decontamination when violations occur
- AST-based detection as primary mechanism
- SSOT-compliant artifact locations
- Post-commit verification discipline
- Test classification and isolation

## Final Status

**Behavioral Learning Ultra Diff COMPLETE**

All identified behavioral patterns from last 12 chats have been codified into enforceable constitutional rules. Future phases will be governed by these learnings to prevent recurrence of evidence contradictions, scope violations, hard-coded bypasses, location violations, post-commit integrity issues, and test isolation problems.

*Rules strengthened: 9 total behavioral governance additions*
*Learning capture: Complete - patterns converted to enforceable rules*

## Rules

1. Follow all constitutional rules and guidelines
2. Maintain compliance with established standards
3. Document all changes and decisions
4. Validate all implementations before completion

- [ ] All objectives completed successfully
- [ ] Validation tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Stakeholder approval received
