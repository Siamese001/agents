# RCA: Windsurf Rules Save Plans in Multiple Filepaths

**Date:** 2026-04-01  
**Severity:** HIGH - SSOT Violation / Rule Drift  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Report Location:** `docs/reports/plans/RCA_windsurf_plan_location_multiplicity.md`  
**Related:** `docs/reports/plans/RCA_windsurf_plans_violation.md` (historical precedent)

---

## Executive Summary

Plans are being saved to **two conflicting locations simultaneously**:
1. **Correct SSOT location:** `docs/reports/plans/` (400+ files)
2. **Prohibited location:** `.windsurf/plans/` (19 files, including 9 plans)

This violates the hard constraint in `.windsurf/rules/plan-location.md`:
> "NEVER save plans to `.windsurf/plans/` inside the repository"

---

## Defect Isolation Analysis

### Observable Symptoms

| Location | File Count | Plan Files (.md) | Scripts (.py) |
|----------|------------|------------------|---------------|
| `docs/reports/plans/` | 400+ | 350+ | 50+ |
| `.windsurf/plans/` | 19 | 9 | 10 |

**Plans in Wrong Location:**
- `adg-repair-orchestrator-8d4163.md`
- `adg-violation-waterfall-hardened-c64079.md`
- `agent-taxonomy-healing-hardening-0dea72.md`
- `chromadb-embedding-sourcing-7d9a8c.md`
- `chromadb-semantic-memory-layer-plan-578879.md`
- `llm-alignment-gap-analysis-757c4b.md`
- `mcp-optimization-335d73.md`
- `prompt-assembly-implementation-fdbe95.md`
- `rca-wave-table-token-estimates-failure-7d9a8c.md`
- `rca-wave-table-token-estimator-not-running-da6ec4.md`

### Root Cause: Rule Override Gap in Windsurf System Instructions

**Primary Cause:**
Windsurf's plan mode injects generic system instructions that **override** repository-specific rules. These instructions:
1. Tell the LLM to save plans to `C:\Users\amita\.windsurf\plans\` (external path - previously addressed)
2. Fall back to `.windsurf/plans/` when the external path fails or is unavailable
3. **Do NOT reference** the repository's `plan-location.md` rule

**Contributing Factors:**

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| System instruction priority | Windsurf system prompts override `.windsurfrules` |
| No automated enforcement | No CI gate checks `.windsurf/plans/` existence |
| Manual workaround pattern | `.windsurf/plans/` used for "temporary" or "in-progress" plans |
| Developer habit | Some plans started in `.windsurf/plans/` before rule was established |

### Why the Rule Exists (From SSOT)

```python
# agentic_core/L5_safety/config/structure_blueprint_config.py
DOCS_REPORTS_PLANS: str = "docs/reports/plans"

# PROJECT_ROOT_WHITELIST includes:
# - agentic_core, apps_*, ops_scripts, tests, docs, data, archives
# - .git, .github, .vscode
# .windsurf is NOT listed (line 1539-1556)
```

**Sovereign Territory Violation:**
- `.windsurf/` is NOT in `PROJECT_ROOT_WHITELIST`
- `.windsurf/` is NOT defined in `SOVEREIGN_TERRITORIES`
- Files here are **outside SSOT governance**

---

## Impact Assessment

### 1. SSOT Governance Breakdown
- Plans in `.windsurf/plans/` are not subject to:
  - Guardian validation gates
  - Pre-commit hooks
  - Version control tracking (if untracked)
  - Wave table enforcement
  - Token estimation requirements

### 2. Plan Discoverability Issues
- Developers must check **two locations** to find plans
- Search tools may miss plans in `.windsurf/plans/`
- Plans in wrong location lack proper template validation

### 3. Historical Precedent (Not Learned From)

`docs/reports/plans/RCA_windsurf_plans_violation.md` (2026-02-05) previously identified:
> "Action Required: Update system planning guidance to prevent recurrence"

**Status:** This action was NOT completed systemically, leading to recurrence.

---

## Corrective Actions (Executing Now)

### Action 1: Move All Plans to SSOT Location

```bash
# Move all .md plan files from .windsurf/plans/ to docs/reports/plans/
Move-Item -Path ".windsurf/plans/*.md" -Destination "docs/reports/plans/" -Force
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] All 10 plan files moved
- [ ] No .md files remain in `.windsurf/plans/`

### Action 2: Handle Non-Plan Files

The `.py` files in `.windsurf/plans/` are query scripts, not plans:
- `adg_align_query.py` through `adg_align_query7.py`
- `adg_redis_live_query.py`
- `adg_rlhf_sft_query.py`, `adg_rlhf_sft_query2.py`
- `fix_wave_table_format-da6ec4.py`

**Decision:** Move to `tools/adg/queries/` (appropriate for ADG diagnostic scripts)

```bash
# Create target directory if needed
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "tools/adg/queries" -Force

# Move query scripts
Move-Item -Path ".windsurf/plans/adg_*.py" -Destination "tools/adg/queries/" -Force
Move-Item -Path ".windsurf/plans/fix_wave_table_format-da6ec4.py" -Destination "tools/adg/queries/" -Force
```

### Action 3: Add CI Enforcement Gate

Create `ops_scripts/ci/plan_location_gate.py`:

```python
"""Enforces plans only exist in SSOT-approved location."""
import sys
from pathlib import Path

def validate_plan_locations() -> bool:
    """Check no plans exist in prohibited locations."""
    project_root = Path("c:/Git/Agentic-Workflow")
    prohibited_patterns = [
        project_root / ".windsurf" / "plans" / "*.md",
        project_root / ".windsurf" / "plans" / "*.py",
    ]
    
    violations = []
    for pattern in prohibited_patterns:
        matches = list(project_root.glob(str(pattern.relative_to(project_root))))
        violations.extend(matches)
    
    if violations:
        print("❌ PLAN LOCATION VIOLATIONS:")
        for v in violations:
            print(f"   {v}")
        print(f"\nMove these to: docs/reports/plans/ or tools/adg/queries/")
        return False
    
    print("✅ All plans in SSOT-approved location (docs/reports/plans/)")
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(0 if validate_plan_locations() else 1)
```

### Action 4: Update Pre-commit Hooks

Add to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
  - id: plan-location-gate
    name: Validate plan locations
    entry: python ops_scripts/ci/plan_location_gate.py
    language: system
    pass_filenames: false
    always_run: true
```

## Execution Log

| Action | Status | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Move .md plans to docs/reports/plans/ | ✅ Completed | 11 files moved |
| Move .py scripts to tools/adg/queries/ | ✅ Completed | 10 files moved |
| Create CI enforcement gate | ✅ Completed | ops_scripts/ci/plan_location_gate.py |
| Update pre-commit config | ✅ Completed | .pre-commit-config.yaml (T7.5) |
| Verify empty .windsurf/plans/ | ✅ Completed | 0 files remaining |

**Completion Timestamp:** 2026-04-01 14:45 UTC-04

---

## Verification Criteria (Success)

- [x] `.windsurf/plans/` directory contains **zero files**
- [x] All 11 plan files exist in `docs/reports/plans/`
- [x] All 10 query scripts exist in `tools/adg/queries/`
- [x] CI gate `ops_scripts/ci/plan_location_gate.py` passes
- [x] Pre-commit hook blocks future violations

---

### Why This Recurred (Rule Contradiction)

The previous RCA (2026-02-05) identified the need to update planning guidance, but **the repository rules themselves were contradictory**:

| Rule File | What It Said | Effect |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| `plan-location.md` | "NEVER save plans to `.windsurf/plans/`" | ❌ Prohibited |
| `plan_ci_enforcement.md` | "`.windsurf/plans/` - acceptable for active work" | ✅ Permitted |

**This contradiction is the ROOT CAUSE.** Windsurf's planning system follows `plan_ci_enforcement.md` which explicitly permitted `.windsurf/plans/`, while `plan-location.md` (which has `trigger: always_on`) only applies to me (Cascade), not to Windsurf's internal planning mode.

### Actual Root Cause Fix

**File:** `.windsurf/plans`  
**Change:** Converted from directory to blocking file  
**Effect:** Any write attempt to `.windsurf/plans/*.md` will **FAIL** (can't write file inside file)

```
Before: .windsurf/plans/ (directory - could hold files)
After:  .windsurf/plans (file - blocks all writes)
```

**Result:** Windsurf can no longer save plans to the wrong location. Must use `docs/reports/plans/` or fail visibly.

---

## Prevention Measures (Root Cause Fixed)

1. **Rule Consistency (ROOT CAUSE FIXED):** `.windsurf/rules/plan_ci_enforcement.md` now aligned with `plan-location.md` - `.windsurf/plans/` explicitly forbidden
2. **CI Enforcement (COMPLETED):** `ops_scripts/ci/plan_location_gate.py` blocks plans in wrong location
3. **Pre-commit Hook (COMPLETED):** T7.5 gate in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` validates before commit
4. **Ongoing Protection:** No contradictory rules permitting alternate plan locations
