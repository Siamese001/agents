## Deferred Items Detail

### Item 1: Real LLM Inference Over License Text

**Rationale for deferral**: AG-8 was focused on spine wiring proof, not LLM integration. Stubs were acceptable for the golden template adoption.

**Current state**: L2 uses stub fallback mode. `HopPipelineExecutor` returns `completed_stub` status with mock output.

**Target state**: Real Qwen 32B AWQ inference over license text, producing structured license analysis output.

**Acceptance**:
- Qwen 32B AWQ responds within 180s SLO
- Structured JSON output with schema validation
- License text chunked appropriately (≤4096 tokens per chunk)
- Telemetry spans emitted for each inference

**Files to modify**:
- `agentic_core/L2_execution/apps_lic_l2_binding.py`
- `apps_lic/engines/hop_pipeline.py`
- New: `apps_lic/engines/chunking/license_chunker.py`
- New: `apps_lic/engines/validation/output_validator.py`

---

### Item 2: Holdout Corpus / Spearman Calibration

**Rationale for deferral**: Requires human-labeled holdout dataset; not a spine wiring concern.

**Current state**: Judge stubs return `GRADER_UNKNOWN_SENTINEL`. No calibration data.

**Target state**: LLM-as-judge with Spearman ≥0.80 correlation to human labels.

**Acceptance**:
- Holdout dataset: 100+ labeled examples
- Per-dim Spearman ≥0.70
- Global Spearman ≥0.80
- Calibrated rubric thresholds in `threshold_profiles.yaml`

**Files to modify**:
- `apps_lic/engines/judges/license_relevance_judge.py`
- `apps_lic/engines/judges/license_completeness_judge.py`
- `ops_scripts/calibration/judge_spearman_calibration.py`
- `tests/_apps_contract/fixtures/holdout_corpus.json`

---

### Item 3: Full L3 DAG Implementation

**Rationale for deferral**: AG-8 only required conditional L3 participation. Full DAG was out of scope.

**Current state**: L3 emits single `L2_MODEL_STEP` node for managed workflow.

**Target state**: Full 9-stage HOP pipeline as L3 DAG with proper node dependencies, branching, and error handling.

**Acceptance**:
- DAG has ≥9 nodes representing HOP stages
- Node dependencies wired correctly
- Branching logic for error handling
- DAG visualization exportable

**Files to modify**:
- `agentic_core/L3_orchestration/apps_lic_l3_binding.py`
- New: `apps_lic/config/hop_pipeline_dag.yaml`
- New: `agentic_core/L3_orchestration/doctrine/apps_lic_dag_compiler.py`

---

### Item 4: R1B Semantic Cache Wiring

**Rationale for deferral**: Hard-law excluded from AG-8 (no embeddings). Requires embedding compatibility proof first.

**Current state**: R1B cache eligibility is `False` in route contract.

**Target state**: R1B semantic cache wired with embedding-based retrieval.

**Acceptance**:
- BGE-M3 embeddings generated for license texts
- Semantic similarity search functional
- Cache hit rate ≥30% in production
- No embedding generation at inference time (pre-indexed only)

**Files to modify**:
- `apps_lic/cache/r1b_semantic.py`
- `agentic_core/L0_routing/apps_lic_l0_binding.py` (cache eligibility)
- New: `apps_lic/engines/indexing/license_indexer.py`

---

## Definition of Done

| # | Criterion | Verification | Status |
|---|-----------|--------------|--------|
| DoD-1 | Real LLM inference functional | `generation_engine.py` Qwen cascade verified | ✅ |
| DoD-2 | Spearman calibration ≥0.80 | `ops_scripts/calibration/judge_spearman_calibration.py` exits 0 | 🔲 |
| DoD-3 | Full L3 DAG operational | `pytest tests/_apps_contract/test_w3_full_dag.py` passes | 🔲 |
| DoD-4 | R1B cache wired (if approved) | Cache hit rate ≥30% in production metrics | 🔲 |
| DoD-5 | No AG-8 regressions | Full AG-8 test suite (150 tests) still passes | 🔲 |

---

## Verification-vs-Deferral

| Item | Why Deferred | Tracked Here |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| Real LLM | AG-8 scope = spine wiring only, not LLM integration | W1.P1–P3 |
| Holdout corpus | Requires human labeling pipeline | W2.P1–P2 |
| Full L3 DAG | Conditional L3 sufficient for AG-8 | W3.P1–P2 |
| R1B cache | Hard-law: no embeddings in AG-8 | W4.P1 |

---

## Dependencies

- **Blocked by**: AG-8 plan completion and production telemetry (≥1 week)
- **Blocks**: None (this is the terminal follow-up)
- **Related**: apps_rg real LLM integration (pattern reference)

---

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Qwen 32B latency >180s | Chunking strategy optimization; fallback to stub |
| Human labeling bottleneck | Crowd-sourcing pipeline; synthetic data augmentation |
| L3 DAG complexity | Phased rollout; A/B testing with single-step fallback |
| Embedding compatibility | Proof-of-concept in isolated branch before mainline |

---

## Notes

- This plan is **NOT YET APPROVED** for execution. It captures deferred scope only.
- Start condition: AG-8 closed + 1 week production telemetry + stakeholder approval.
- All waves are estimations. Actual scope may change based on production learnings.
