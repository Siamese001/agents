# apps_rg Prompt Authority Coverage Review and Hardening (AG-8)

Zero-loss prompt authority coverage audit and hardening: discover, classify, map, prove, and gate every apps_rg instructional prompt and prompt-related artifact across the full agentic spine.

---

## Context (SCQA)

- **Situation** — apps_rg is the golden reference implementation. AG-1 proved U0 live reflection. AG-2 proved app_payload consumption through L1/L0/C0/PA. AG-4 created evidence carrier contracts. AG-5 wired Exit X1 evaluator checks. AG-6 proved apps_rg golden path runtime. AG-7 extracted apps_rg as reusable template. The PROMPT_BOUNDARY_CONTRACT.md declares slot authority S0–R0, dual PA topology, and airlocks U0/C0/tool-model/human-reentry. The prompt_registry.yaml catalogues 8 templates. The spine owns 15+ prompt-related files across apps_rg/, agentic_core/prompt_governance/, and config/.
- **Complication** — No single inventory certifies that every prompt surface is discovered, authority-classified, mapped to a contract field, consumed only by allowed spine stages, hashed for replay, and covered by tests and CI gates. The dual PA topology (NEW PA compiler + LEGACY PA bridge + narrative-pipeline PA instrumentation) creates three separate assembly surfaces, any of which could silently accept out-of-authority prompt sources. No CI gate today fails if PA omits slot_lineage_map or component_hash_map entries.
- **Question** — How do we exhaustively inventory, authority-classify, contract-map, stage-fence, hash, and CI-gate every apps_rg prompt surface to guarantee zero prompt authority bypass in the active runtime?
- **Answer** — Execute a six-wave audit (W0 baseline → W1 discovery → W2 classification → W3 stage matrix → W4 contract mapping → W5 hardening → W6 tests → W7 CI gate → W8 artifacts) producing a complete, machine-verifiable inventory that proves the invariant: every instructional prompt is consumed only by its allowed stage, blocked from forbidden stages, hashed for replay, and UNKNOWN never treated as PASS.

---

## Hard Laws (copied verbatim — invariants, not goals)

- Do not create a parallel apps_rg runtime.
- Do not bypass U0, L1, L0, C0, PA, L2, Exit, X1, or X3.
- Do not mutate ChromaDB.
- Do not generate embeddings.
- Do not wire R1B semantic cache.
- Do not change provider behavior unless required for prompt-ref preservation.
- Do not let lower-authority app prompts override system, policy, route, registry, evidence, or schema authority.
- U0 does not reason, route, retrieve, execute, or assemble prompts.
- L1 may interpret intent and emit planning projections, but must not route with authority.
- L0 may route only from governed contract fields, not free-form prompt text.
- C0 retrieves and verifies evidence only. It does not answer or assemble prompts.
- PA composes prompts only from governed contracts and approved prompt slots.
- L2 executes bounded packets only. It must not invent new instructions.
- Exit evaluates sealed results. It must not retrieve or assemble prompts.
- Retrieved text remains data only.
- UNKNOWN is never PASS.
- NOT_APPLICABLE requires reason.

## W2: Classify Every Prompt by Authority and Slot

### Authority Classes

| Class | Definition |
|---|---|
| SYSTEM_AUTHORITY | Immutable invariants (no fabrication, ATS floor, no L4 direct write) |
| POLICY_AUTHORITY | App-level policy rules (HITL policy, route policy, capability policy) |
| ROUTE_RULE | Structured routing fields consumed by L0 (not free-form text) |
| DOMAIN_INSTRUCTION | Per-template operating instructions (I0 slot) |
| USER_TASK | CLI args / wizard input / manual brief content (U0, neutralized) |
| EVIDENCE_DATA | JD, master résumé, company brief — data only (C0) |
| EXAMPLE_DATA | Approved few-shot exemplars (E0) |
| OUTPUT_SCHEMA | Response schema binding (R0) |
| HEAL_HINT | Bounded repair hints for E4_HEAL (H0) |
| EVALUATOR_RUBRIC | Exit/X1 evaluator inputs — NOT generation authority |
| PROVIDER_RENDER_CONTROL | Provider-safe controls (M0) |
| LEARNING_PRIOR | Reasoning priors / planning priors consumed by L1 |
| TEST_ONLY | Test-fixture prompts that must never reach production |

### Slot Mapping Rules

| Slot | Maps from | Never from |
|---|---|---|
| S0 | SYSTEM_AUTHORITY | anything else |
| D0 | fences, anti-injection controls | — |
| I0 | approved DOMAIN_INSTRUCTION | USER_TASK, EVIDENCE_DATA, EVALUATOR_RUBRIC |
| E0 | EXAMPLE_DATA | system authority |
| C0 | EVIDENCE_DATA | — |
| M0 | PROVIDER_RENDER_CONTROL | — |
| U0 | USER_TASK (neutralized) | S0/D0/I0/R0 override |
| H0 | HEAL_HINT (same-authority) | widen route/tool/model/schema/policy |
| R0 | OUTPUT_SCHEMA | user/retrieved/tool/model/human text |

Output: `artifacts/apps_rg/ag8_prompt_authority_classification.json`

---

## W3: Stage Consumption Matrix

### Stages

`U0 | L1 | L0 | C0 | PA | L2 | Exit/X1 | L6`

### Stage Consumption Rules

| Stage | May consume | Must not consume |
|---|---|---|
| U0 | prompt-related fields as DATA only | instructional prompts as authority |
| L1 | planning/domain intent fields → L1PlanContract projections | raw prompt text, route authority |
| L0 | structured L1PlanContract fields only | raw prompt text, free-form instructions |
| C0 | retrieval/evidence requirements | generation instructions |
| PA | governed contracts + approved prompt slots only | raw app prompts, loose dict/string |
| L2 | CompiledPromptArtifact + sealed execution packet | raw app prompts |
| Exit | evaluator rubrics + structured evidence refs | generation instructions as authority |
| L6 | completed-run prompt metadata only | runtime prompt assembly |

Output: `artifacts/apps_rg/ag8_prompt_stage_consumption_matrix.json`

---

## W4: Contract Mapping

### Contract Chain

```
ValidatedRequest.app_payload
  → L1PlanContract fields
    → RouteContract fields
      → FinalEvidenceContract fields
        → CompiledPromptArtifact fields (slot_lineage_map, component_hash_map)
          → SealedL2Artifact refs
            → ExitReviewPacket refs
              → X1CheckoutResult refs
```

### Required Proofs

- No prompt passed as loose dict/string without a contract ref.
- Every prompt has content_hash or component_hash.
- PA component_hash_map includes all used prompt components.
- PA slot_lineage_map traces every prompt slot to source.
- prompt_hash changes when meaningful instructional prompt content changes.
- route_digest does not change from prompt text unless L1/L0 structured fields change.
- L0 does not parse raw instructional prompt text.

Outputs:
- `artifacts/apps_rg/ag8_prompt_contract_mapping.json`
- `artifacts/apps_rg/ag8_prompt_no_bypass_map.json`

16. Evaluator rubric maps to Exit/X1, not generation authority.
17. L2 does not load raw apps_rg prompts directly.
18. Exit does not assemble prompts.

> 4. **Stage-fenced** — consumed only by allowed spine stages, blocked from forbidden stages
> 5. **Hashed for replay** — has `content_hash` or `component_hash`
> 6. **PA-represented** — in `slot_lineage_map`/`component_hash_map` when used
> 7. **Test-proven** — all 24 test cases pass
> 8. **CI-gated** — gate passes with zero violations
> 9. **ChromaDB-clean** — no ChromaDB mutation, no embedding generation
