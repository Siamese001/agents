# Apps Tier Hardening Plan — Structural Alignment with apps_lic/apps_rg Gold Standard

## Executive Summary

This plan hardens apps_eval, apps_exec, apps_research, and apps_rfp to match the architectural rigor, depth, and integration quality of apps_lic and apps_rg (the original gold-standard apps).

**Target State:** All apps_* folders achieve:
- Full lifecycle trace contract integration (P0-P4)
- Complete ADG edge coverage (31/31 dimensions at 100%)
- Structural depth parity (services/, enforcement/, reasoning/ agents)
- End-to-end integration test coverage
- Sovereign territory compliance per Structure Blueprint

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Config Hardening

### 1.1 Lifecycle Trace Contract Integration
**Scope:** All apps_*/config/agent_spec_config.py

**Pattern (from apps_rg):**
```python
from agentic_core.runtime.lifecycle_trace_contract import (
    _emit_applies_guardrail,
    _emit_reads_policy_state,
    _emit_snapshots_state,
    # ... all 31 emitters
)

# Self-bootstrap calls for P0-P4 coverage
_emit_applies_guardrail("p0", "agent_spec_config", "p0_governance")
_emit_reads_policy_state("p0", "agent_spec_config", "policy_binding")
# ... all 31 dimensions
```

**Per-App Target:**
- apps_eval: Add 90+ _emit_* calls for P0-P4 coverage
- apps_exec: Add 90+ _emit_* calls for P0-P4 coverage
- apps_research: Add 90+ _emit_* calls for P0-P4 coverage
- apps_rfp: Add 90+ _emit_* calls for P0-P4 coverage

### 1.2 Agent Spec Schema Completion
**Pattern (from apps_rg):**
- Pydantic BaseModel with Field validators
- model_validator for cross-field validation
- LayerSegment imports for trace context
- Full __all__ exports

**Implementation:**
Each app's config must define:
- Root config class (e.g., `EvalAgentSpecs`, `ExecAgentSpecs`)
- Sub-configs for each capability area
- Validation methods with trace emission

---

## Phase 2: Structural Depth (services/, enforcement/)

### 2.1 services/ Layer Construction
**Gold Standard Pattern (apps_lic):**
- Services as discrete capability units
- Each service has single responsibility
- Unified error handling via SovereignBase patterns
- Trace emission at entry/exit points

**Implementation Per App:**

### 2.2 enforcement/ Layer (Optional Enhancement)
**Pattern (from apps_rg):**
- Strategy pattern for enforcement
- Hardened executors with safety checks
- Boundary validation

**Decision:** Add to apps_eval first (evaluation safety critical), others as needed.

---

## Phase 3: Agent Ecosystem Expansion

---

## Phase 4: ADG Integration & Spine Wiring

### 4.1 Spine Adapter Enhancement
**Pattern:** Each app has spine/spine_adapter.py but minimal wiring

**Enhancement:**
- Full ADG client integration
- Lifecycle trace emission at adapter boundaries
- Circuit breaker pattern for resilience
- Routing tier integration

### 4.2 ADG Edge Coverage Target
**Goal:** 31/31 P0-P4 dimensions at 100% for each app

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Batch wiring via script (similar to P0-P4 hardening)
- Self-bootstrap in agent_spec_config.py
- Visitor updates in static_scanner.py for app-specific patterns

---

## Phase 5: End-to-End Integration Testing

### 5.1 Integration Test Structure
```
tests/integration/apps_eval/
  test_eval_end_to_end.py
  test_eval_spine_integration.py
  test_eval_adg_integration.py
  
tests/integration/apps_exec/
  test_exec_end_to_end.py
  test_exec_spine_integration.py
  test_exec_adg_integration.py
  
[similar for apps_research, apps_rfp]
```

### 5.2 Test Coverage Requirements
- Config loading and validation
- Engine initialization and execution
- Service orchestration
- Agent reasoning chains
- Spine adapter routing
- ADG trace emission
- Error handling and recovery

- [ ] Spine adapter routes correctly to agentic_core
- [ ] ADG shows 31/31 dimensions for app modules
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] No import errors or circular dependencies

### 6.2 Cross-App Validation
- [ ] Consistent patterns across all apps_*

| Import cycles | Layer boundary enforcement (L0-L6 gravity rules) |

---

## Success Criteria

1. **Structural Depth:** All apps have services/, reasoning/ agents, enforcement/ (where applicable)
2. **Trace Coverage:** 31/31 P0-P4 dimensions at 100% per ADG
3. **Integration:** All end-to-end tests pass
4. **Quality:** No new ADG violations introduced
