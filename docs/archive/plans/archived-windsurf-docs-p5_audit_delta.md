**Audit contract**: Prompt v5.0 Enhanced (unchanged)
**Discovery hash**: `f09ec166b82746f6d62cf1c7e9215de70ec29534f784bee95d13798b04da4fd4` (unchanged)

## P5 Items — Before / After

| Audit § | Capability | Before | After | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| §7.4.1 | Signature Enclave subsystem | MISSING | **COMPLIANT** | `agentic_core/L0_maintenance/types/v15_p5_types.py::SignatureEnclave` (ABC, lines 258–274) + `DeterministicTestEnclave` (lines 277–316) — deterministic HMAC-SHA256, no wall-clock/env |
| §7.4.2 | Signatures verifiable against pinned Public Keys | MISSING | **COMPLIANT** | `v15_p5_types.py::TrustRoot` (lines 72–90) + `v15_p5_contracts.py::verify_signature` (lines 93–128) — key lookup, ACTIVE/REVOKED check, fail-closed |
| §7.4 | Guardian signed artifact (env metadata, commit hash, signature) | FAIL | **COMPLIANT** | `v15_p5_contracts.py::sign_artifact` (lines 51–79) → `SignatureEnvelope` (lines 101–131 in types) — trace_id, artifact_hash, key_id, signature, algorithm, semantic_clock_tick |
| §7.2.1 | GuardianArtifact signed (trace_id, signature, prestaged_perms) | FAIL | **COMPLIANT** | `v15_p5_types.py::SignedGuardianArtifact` (lines 140–175) — frozen, 6 required fields per spec |
| §1.7 | SignedModify artifact | MISSING | **COMPLIANT** | `v15_p5_types.py::SignedModify` (lines 196–230) — frozen, trace_id + human_reviewer_id + resolution (APPROVE/REJECT/MODIFY) + modified_manifest + signature |
| §7.2 | Artifact Guard (Replay Comparison + Valid Signature) | MISSING | **COMPLIANT** | `v15_p5_contracts.py::ReplayGuardStore` (lines 143–175) + `record_and_block_replay` (lines 178–184) — blocks on second sighting, fail-closed |
| §2.6 | ≥2 hash mismatches → human escalation | MISSING | **COMPLIANT** | `v15_p5_types.py::HashMismatchTracker` (lines 244–256) + `v15_p5_contracts.py::record_hash_mismatch` (lines 193–201) — threshold=2, raises EscalationRequiredError |

**P5 Total: 7/7 COMPLIANT**
