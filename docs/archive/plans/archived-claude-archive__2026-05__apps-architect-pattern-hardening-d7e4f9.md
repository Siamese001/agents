# apps_architect — Pattern Collection & Repo Hardening Engine

Build an app that continuously collects best-in-class methodologies and genetic architecture patterns from recent development, computes delta from current repo state, and emits hardening rules with automatic README synchronization to GitHub.

---

## Context (SCQA)

- **Situation** — Over the last month, 250+ plans landed establishing canonical patterns: agentic spine manifests, FEC producers, eval harness wiring, C0 retrieval patterns, and prompt assembly best practices. These patterns exist in scattered plan files, ADG snapshots, and rule definitions, but are not systematically harvested or enforced.

- **Complication** — Without automated pattern detection and hardening, repos drift from established best practices. Manual README updates lag weeks behind pattern changes. New apps lack a single source for "how we build things now" — they copy-paste from outdated templates.

- **Question** — How do we build an app that continuously observes recent methodological evolution, computes drift from current repo patterns, and emits actionable hardening guidance with automatic documentation sync?

- **Answer** — apps_architect: an R3_grounded_read app that scans recent plans/ADG/rules (C0 over `.cursor/plans/` + `agentic_core/` patterns), computes delta via ADG layer violation detection, generates hardening rule recommendations, and publishes findings to a living README with GitHub API integration.

## Gap Register

**GAP-1: C0 collection scope definition**
- Need to define exact C0 collections for `.cursor/plans/`, `agentic_core/`, and rules
- Impact: Blocks W1 C0 retrieval profile completion

**GAP-2: Pattern schema versioning**
- Patterns evolve; need schema_version field in emitted hardening rules
- Impact: W3 rule generator must support backward compatibility

**GAP-3: GitHub token security**
- Need secure storage for GitHub API token (env var vs L4 secret)
- Impact: W4 GitHub integration security posture

**Scope**: Declare R3_grounded_read route with C0-required over patterns collections

**Files**:
- `apps_architect/spine_manifest.yaml`

**Key content**:
```yaml
schema_version: 1
app: apps_architect
claimed_routes:
  - type: R3_grounded_read
    description: >-
      Pattern collection and delta analysis over recent methodology.
      Scans .cursor/plans/, agentic_core/, and .cursor/rules/
      via C0 retrieval to extract canonical patterns, computes drift
      from current repo state, emits hardening rules.
    c0_required: true
    pa_required: true
    source_collection: architect_pattern_docs
    notes:
      - "C0 mandatory — patterns are grounded in actual recent plans/rules"
      - "No CommitRequest — output is documentation + recommendations"
```

**Acceptance**: Manifest validated by `apps_spine_coverage.py` scanner

---

### Phase 1.2 — Entrypoint + FEC Wiring
**Scope**: Canonical __main__.py with cert/FEC pattern matching apps_research

**Files**:
- `apps_architect/__main__.py`
- `apps_architect/cert/__init__.py`
- `apps_architect/cert/fec_producer.py`

**Pattern**: Copy from `apps_research/cert/fec_producer.py` with:
- `producer: apps_architect`
- `grounded: true` (when C0 retrieval sources populate)
- `retrieval_sources: ["plans", "rules", "core_patterns"]`

**Acceptance**: `resolve_fec("apps_architect", run_ctx)` returns valid FEC

---

### Phase 1.3 — C0 Retrieval Profile
**Scope**: Define domain contract for pattern document retrieval

**Files**:
- `apps_architect/config/domain_contract/retrieval_profile.yaml`

    source_ref: str  # file path or ADG node id
    content_digest: str  # SHA256 of canonical form
    first_seen: datetime

    schema_version: str = "1.0"

class PatternCollection:
    patterns: Tuple[Pattern, ...]
    collection_digest: str
```

**Acceptance**: Patterns are hashable, comparable, serializable

---

### Phase 3.2 — Delta Computation Engine

- `apps_architect/integrations/github_sync.py`

**Flow**:
1. Detect README drift
2. Create feature branch `architect/update-<timestamp>`

- `architect.delta` — drift computation
- `architect.rules` — rule generation
- `architect.sync` — GitHub sync

**Acceptance**: Spans visible in OTEL collector

---

### Phase 5.2 — Exit v6 + Eval Harness
**Scope**: Certification entry and eval wiring

**Files**:
- `apps_architect/config/cert_route_registry.yaml`
- `apps_architect/config/domain_contract/eval_rubrics.yaml`
- `apps_architect/config/domain_contract/threshold_profiles.yaml`

**Rubrics**:
- Pattern extraction accuracy
- Delta precision (false positive rate)
- Rule usefulness (human judgment)
- Sync success rate

**Acceptance**: Eval harness runs, Exit v6 produces disposition

---

## Rules

1. **Pattern immutability** — Once a pattern is identified, its canonical form never changes; new versions get new pattern_ids
2. **Delta determinism** — Same codebase state always produces same delta (no timestamps in hash inputs)
3. **Fail-soft on ADG** — If ADG MCP unavailable, degrade to file scanning with warning
4. **Human gate for required rules** — Severity=required rules require Author-Gate approval before auto-PR
5. **Read-only on repo** — Never modifies source files directly; only emits recommendations and README updates

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] W1: apps_architect skeleton exists, cert/FEC wired, C0 retrieval configured
- [ ] W2: Pattern scanners extract ≥20 distinct patterns from recent plans/rules/core
- [ ] W3: Delta computation identifies ≥5 actionable hardening opportunities
- [ ] W4: GitHub PR auto-created with README update on drift detection
- [ ] W5: Exit v6 integration complete, eval harness registered, OTEL spans emitted
- [ ] End-to-end: `python -m apps_architect scan` → delta report → rules generated in <30s

---

## Implementation Commands

```bash
# W1: Bootstrap app structure
mkdir -p apps_architect/{config/{domain_contract,specs},engines,types,cert,cli,L6_observability,integrations,templates}
touch apps_architect/__init__.py

# W2-W3: Pattern extraction test
cd apps_architect && python -m pytest tests/test_pattern_extraction.py -v

# W4: GitHub sync dry run
python -m apps_architect readme --sync --dry-run

# W5: Eval harness
python ops_scripts/ci/check_app_domain_harness_parity.py --app apps_architect
```

---

## Rollback Strategy

If pattern detection is too noisy:
1. Increase `scan_depth_days` threshold (reduce sensitivity)
2. Add exclusion patterns for noisy file types
3. Degrade severity levels (required → recommended)
4. Disable auto-PR, switch to manual review queue

---

## Acceptance Criteria

| Metric | Target | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| Pattern extraction coverage | ≥90% of recent plans | Unit test over sample plans |
| Delta false positive rate | <5% | Manual audit of 20 samples |
| Rule generation latency | <5s per pattern | Benchmark in CI |
| End-to-end scan latency | <30s for 30-day window | Integration test |
| README sync success rate | >95% | OTEL span metrics |

---

## Cursor Agent Alignment Checks

- Leverages ADG graph-layer primitives (mv_hotspot_centrality, v_p views) per §22
- C0 retrieval over structured collections per R3_grounded_read pattern
- FEC producer follows established pattern from apps_research/apps_rfp
- Exit v6 integration matches eval harness parity requirement
- GitHub integration uses fail-soft pattern with dry-run gate
