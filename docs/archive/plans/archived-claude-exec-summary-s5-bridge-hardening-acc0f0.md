# Executive Summary — S5 Derivatives Inventory + Stock Bridge Hardening

Close the two X2 blockers surfaced by Brown & Brown SVP run [`exec_summary_20260527_074803`](../../artifacts/apps_rg/runtime_proofs/executive_summary/real/exec_summary_20260527_074803): `x2_exec_summary_s5_no_derivatives_inventory` caused by C0 non-capsule path exposing `fact_quant_hpc_003.claim_text` verbatim (contains "derivatives pricing"), and `x2_exec_summary_stock_bridge_max_two` caused by the composition plan emitting no per-sentence S4 opener directive, allowing the LLM to stack three consecutive stock bridges.

## Context (SCQA)

- **Situation** — Executive-summary lane (SVP strategy lane, Qwen scratch) runs the `format_selected_facts_for_c0` path by default (evidence capsule not active). That path dumps each selected fact's `claim_text` raw into the C0 SELECTED_FACT_PLAN block. `fact_quant_hpc_003.claim_text` contains the phrase "derivatives pricing, capital modeling, and portfolio stress analytics" — which triggers the `_S5_DERIVATIVES_INVENTORY_RE` gate. The composition plan (`format_composition_plan_for_pa`) provides brushstroke roles and `s5_metric_binding` but emits no per-sentence opener prescription for S2–S4, allowing the LLM to stack three consecutive stock bridges.
- **Complication** — W2.3 of plan `exec-summary-brown-gap-hardening-b9e4c1` added `preferred_display_framing` for `fact_quant_hpc_003` but only wired it to the evidence capsule path (`use_capsule=True`). The default non-capsule path was never patched. The stock bridge gate was added in W2.1 (fires correctly) but the composition block has never included an S4 non-stock opener directive.
- **Question** — How do we ensure (a) `fact_quant_hpc_003` never exposes "derivatives pricing" through any C0 path, and (b) the model receives a per-sentence directive that forces variety at S4 when S2 and S3 already consume two stock bridge slots?
- **Answer** — (W1) Add `FACT_C0_DISPLAY_OVERRIDES` in `executive_summary_synthesis_contract.py` and apply it unconditionally in `format_selected_facts_for_c0`. (W2) Emit `s4_opener_directive` in `format_composition_plan_for_pa` for SVP strategy lanes with ≥3 S2–S4 brushstrokes. (W3) Persist `preferred_c0_display_text` on the graph node for `fact_quant_hpc_003` so future ledger reads also carry the safe framing. (W4) Unit test all three seams.

## Wave 0 — Plan registration

WAVE_ID: W0
WAVE_STATUS: DONE
WAVE_COMPLETE: YES
AUTHORIZATION_STATUS: NOT_REQUIRED

**Acceptance**
- [x] [`.cursor/plans/exec-summary-s5-bridge-hardening-acc0f0.md`](exec-summary-s5-bridge-hardening-acc0f0.md) on disk.
- [ ] Notion Plans row: `Status=In Progress` — pending Notion registration in same response.

---

## Wave 1 — C0 framing override

WAVE_ID: W1
WAVE_STATUS: IN PROGRESS
AUTHORIZATION_STATUS: NOT_REQUIRED

**Phases**
- [ ] **W1.1** — Add `FACT_C0_DISPLAY_OVERRIDES: dict[str, str]` to `executive_summary_synthesis_contract.py`. Key = `fact_id`, value = safe C0 display line. Entry for `fact_quant_hpc_003`: "FSA-chartered quantitative foundation, built through early-career capital modeling and portfolio stress analytics."
- [ ] **W1.2** — In `format_selected_facts_for_c0` (`executive_summary_pa.py`), check `FACT_C0_DISPLAY_OVERRIDES` before using `claim_text`. If override exists, emit `{fid}: {override_text} [preferred_display_framing]` instead.

**Acceptance**
- [ ] C0 output for any fact list containing `fact_quant_hpc_003` does NOT contain "derivatives pricing".
- [ ] Unit test `test_format_selected_facts_for_c0_excludes_derivatives_phrase` passes.

---

## Wave 2 — Composition plan S4 opener directive

WAVE_ID: W2
WAVE_STATUS: PENDING
AUTHORIZATION_STATUS: NOT_REQUIRED

**Phases**
- [ ] **W2.1** — In `format_composition_plan_for_pa` (`executive_summary_composition.py`), when the plan is an SVP strategy lane (`strategy_executive=True` or `dominant_arc == "B2_governed_platform_system"`) and brushstroke count ≥ 3, append: `s4_opener_directive: use non-stock opener for S4 (e.g. "In parallel," / "That operating foundation also,") — S2 and S3 consume both stock bridge slots`.

**Acceptance**
- [ ] `format_composition_plan_for_pa` output for a 4-brushstroke SVP plan contains `s4_opener_directive`.
- [ ] Unit test `test_composition_plan_s4_opener_directive_svp_lane` passes.

---

## Wave 3 — Graph-ledger preferred_c0_display_text

WAVE_ID: W3
WAVE_STATUS: PENDING
AUTHORIZATION_STATUS: NOT_REQUIRED

**Phases**
- [ ] **W3.1** — Add `"preferred_c0_display_text": "FSA-chartered quantitative foundation, built through early-career capital modeling and portfolio stress analytics."` to the `fact_quant_hpc_003` node in `master_skills_arsenal_ledger.json`. Update `format_selected_facts_for_c0` to read `fact.get("preferred_c0_display_text")` first, then fall back to `FACT_C0_DISPLAY_OVERRIDES`, then `claim_text`.

**Acceptance**
- [ ] `fact_quant_hpc_003` node in ledger has `preferred_c0_display_text`.
- [ ] `format_selected_facts_for_c0` uses graph-data-driven framing when available.

## Wave 4 — Unit tests

WAVE_ID: W4
WAVE_STATUS: PENDING
AUTHORIZATION_STATUS: NOT_REQUIRED

**Test file:** `tests/unit/apps_rg/test_executive_summary_w4_s5_bridge_hardening.py`

**Tests**
- [ ] `test_format_selected_facts_for_c0_excludes_derivatives_phrase` — `fact_quant_hpc_003` in selected facts → C0 output does NOT contain "derivatives pricing".
- [ ] `test_composition_plan_s4_opener_directive_svp_lane` — SVP lane, 4 brushstrokes → `s4_opener_directive` present.
- [ ] `test_stock_bridge_gate_regression_triple_stack` — exact failing text from run `074803` → gate returns `False, "stock_bridge_stack:3..."`.

**Acceptance**
