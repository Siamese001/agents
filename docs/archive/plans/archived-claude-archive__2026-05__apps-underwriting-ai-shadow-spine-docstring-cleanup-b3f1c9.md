# apps_underwriting_ai Shadow-Spine Docstring Cleanup

**Plan slug**: `apps-underwriting-ai-shadow-spine-docstring-cleanup-b3f1c9`  
**Parent**: `one-spine-qna-rfp-migration-d2e8f1` (residual warning register)  
**Status**: COMPLETED (2026-05-14, single session)

---

## Plan State Markers

```
FORMAT_VERSION: simplified-plan-format-v1
PLAN_STATUS: COMPLETED
LAST_UPDATED: 2026-05-14
PARENT_PLAN: one-spine-qna-rfp-migration-d2e8f1
```

---

## Goal

Remove the 4 residual SS-4 scanner warnings in `apps_underwriting_ai` docstrings
that were surfaced (and intentionally left unsuppressed) by the one-spine migration
(plan `d2e8f1`). Accept criteria:

- `NO_SHADOW_SPINE_FAIL_CLOSED=1 python ops_scripts/ci/check_no_shadow_spine.py`
  returns **0 errors, 0 warnings**
- No runtime code behavior changes
- No scanner weakening (`check_no_shadow_spine.py` untouched)

---

## Scope

| File | Lines changed |
|------|--------------|
| `apps_underwriting_ai/runtime/l6_shadow.py` | 4, 69, 72 (docstrings only) |
| `apps_underwriting_ai/runtime/bindings/l2_binding.py` | 36 (docstring only) |

`check_no_shadow_spine.py` — **not touched**.

---

## What Changed

### `apps_underwriting_ai/runtime/l6_shadow.py`

| Line | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| 4 | `RuntimeExhaustBundle from the DispatchResult and runs it through the` | `RuntimeExhaustBundle from the completed dispatch result and runs it through the` |
| 69 | `"""Run L6 shadow learning on a completed DispatchResult.` | `"""Run L6 shadow learning on a completed underwriting dispatch result.` |
| 72 | `dispatch_result: DispatchResult from run_underwriting_dispatch().` | `dispatch_result: result object from run_underwriting_dispatch().` |

### `apps_underwriting_ai/runtime/bindings/l2_binding.py`

| Line | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| 36 | `so the Exit stage can build the full DispatchResult / X3 disposition.` | `so the Exit stage can build the full underwriting disposition / X3 packet.` |

All 4 changes are **docstring prose only**. The parameter name `dispatch_result`
(line 66 of `l6_shadow.py`) is executable — it was not changed.

---

## Final Scanner Output

```
NO_SHADOW_SPINE_FAIL_CLOSED=1 python ops_scripts/ci/check_no_shadow_spine.py
→ NO_SHADOW_SPINE: scanned 1040 files — 0 errors, 0 warnings
→ Deferred (excluded from pass/fail): []
→ OK: no shadow-spine violations detected — all apps scoped
→ exit 0  ✅
```

**DEFERRED_APPS: `set()` — empty**

---

## Runtime Behavior Confirmation

- No executable statements modified
- No function signatures changed
- No imports added or removed
- `check_no_shadow_spine.py` not modified
