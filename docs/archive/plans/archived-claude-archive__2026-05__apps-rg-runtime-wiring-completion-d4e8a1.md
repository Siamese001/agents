# Plan: apps_rg Runtime Wiring Completion + W0–W9 RCA

**Slug:** `apps-rg-runtime-wiring-completion-d4e8a1`
**Status:** Not Started
**Tier:** T3 — cross-layer, multi-file, architectural, governance
**Created:** 2026-05-09
**Re-opens:** `apps-rg-declarative-ingress-only-spinal-governance-c8b3e1` (was marked W9 COMPLETE 2026-05-09; this plan establishes that close-out was premature and lands the missing wiring)
**Constitutional anchors:** §6 (Author-Gate), §22 (graph-layer evidence), §32 (Fort Knox / DoD discipline), §35 (queue drain), §36 (plan registration)

---

## §1. Executive Summary

Plan `c8b3e1` declared 9 waves complete (W0–W9) on 2026-05-09. Empirical verification on the same day shows **`python -m apps_rg` does not run end-to-end through any documented entrypoint**. This plan:

1. Performs a forensic RCA on why W0–W9 closed without a working runtime
2. Lands the W5/W6/W7 wiring that was claimed-but-not-shipped
3. Adds Definition-of-Done discipline so no future apps_* refactor plan can close on absence-tests alone

---

## §2. Root Cause Analysis — Why W0–W9 Did Not Finish

### §2.1 Empirical evidence (2026-05-09 run)

```
$ python -m apps_rg --target-company "Brown & Brown" --target-role "..." \
    --source-resume "..." --jd "..." --manual-brief "..."

✅ apps_rg package import           (only after ad-hoc removal of __init__.py:bootstrap_runtime import)
✅ CLI argparse
✅ Wizard skip (all flags provided)
✅ Ingress payload dict construction (line 192)
❌ AppIngressRunner()  line 241
   TypeError: AppIngressRunner.__init__() missing 3 required keyword-only
   arguments: 'dispatch', 'parse', and 'required_fields'
```

Subsequent inspection identified **6 distinct defects** declared resolved by W5/W6 but actually unresolved:

| # | Defect | Where | Discovered |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | `apps_rg/__init__.py` imports `bootstrap_runtime.install_runtime_shims` from a quarantined module | `apps_rg/__init__.py:3` | This session |
| D2 | `apps_rg/__main__.py` imports `RequestEnvelope` — symbol does not exist in payload module | `apps_rg/__main__.py:24-27` (pre-fix) | This session |
| D3 | `apps_rg/__main__.py` references `args.research_via` — argparse never defines `--research-via` | `apps_rg/__main__.py:216` (pre-fix) | This session |
| D4 | `apps_rg/__main__.py` instantiates `AppIngressRunner()` with no kwargs — class requires `dispatch=`/`parse=`/`required_fields=` | `apps_rg/__main__.py:241` | This session |
| D5 | `apps_rg/__main__.py` calls `runner.run(payload_dict)` — class exposes `handle_chat()`/`handle_http()` only | `apps_rg/__main__.py:233` | This session |
| D6 | Wizard crashes with `EOFError` traceback in non-TTY contexts (e.g. all Cursor Agent runs) | `apps_rg/__main__.py:_interactive_wizard` (pre-fix) | This session |

D1, D2, D3, D6 were patched ad-hoc this session. D4 and D5 are the architectural gaps — the W6/W7 work that was never landed.

### §2.2 Why W5 was marked complete despite D2/D3/D4/D5

W5 acceptance criteria (per c8b3e1 plan §13 line 723–728) was:
> "✅ W5 COMPLETE — Ingress-only architecture, 15/15 bypass tests passing:
> - AG-RGGOV-1: `apps_rg/__main__.py` rewritten as pure ingress shim
> - AppsRgIngressPayload + RequestEnvelope dataclasses (immutable, frozen)
> - CLI argument parsing + interactive wizard input collection
> - AppIngressRunner delegation (fail-closed if runner unavailable)
> - 15 W5 ingress-only tests (no planner/router/orchestrator/prompt/executor/provider)"

The 15 bypass tests are **negative-pattern tests** — they assert *forbidden-pattern absence* (no planner imports, no router imports, no provider calls). They prove governance compliance. **They do not prove capability.** A file that does nothing also passes all 15.

The W5 acceptance criteria did not include:
- An `import apps_rg` smoke test
- An `python -m apps_rg --help` smoke test
- A `python -m apps_rg --dry-run` smoke test
- Any end-to-end resume-generation smoke test

This is **test theater** — passing tests gave false confidence. The plan was closed without the most basic capability check.

### §2.3 Why W6/W7/W8 were marked complete despite D4/D5

c8b3e1 plan status table (line 743–748) shows:

| ID | Chosen Option | W3 | W4 | W5 | W6 | W7 | W8 |
|----|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| AG-RGGOV-1 | Extend `AppIngressRunner` | — | — | ✅ | ✅ | — | — |

The W6 work was supposed to (per plan §13 line 495):
> "W6.1 — U0 ingress validator | `agentic_core/runtime/entry/` or U0 module | Reject forbidden authority fields | ~1 k"

What actually exists in the repo:
- `agentic_core/runtime/entry/app_ingress_runner.py` — **generic** wrapper requiring `dispatch=`/`parse=`/`required_fields=`. NOT extended for apps_rg.
- No `agentic_core/runtime/entry/apps_rg_dispatch.py` exists.
- No `apps_rg`-specific U0 binding exists.
- No `.run(AppsRgIngressPayload)` method exists on AppIngressRunner.
- No L1 binding emitting `L1PlanContract` from `AppsRgProfileManifest.planning_profile_ref`.
- No L0 binding emitting `RouteContract` for `resume_generation` task class.

The W6 checkmark was applied without the corresponding code shipping.

### §2.4 Why W4 quarantine left orphan code

W4 quarantined ALL `apps_rg/` runtime authority (correct per AG-RGGOV-8) but the replacement core wiring was promised to W5/W6/W7 and never landed. Result: `apps_rg/` is in an **orphan state** — old runtime is dead-on-import, new runtime doesn't exist. The bootstrap chain `apps_rg/__init__.py → bootstrap_runtime → install_runtime_shims()` was left in place pointing at a quarantined target — verifying *nothing imports apps_rg* would have caught this in 1 line of test:

```python
def test_apps_rg_imports():
    import apps_rg  # would have failed loud on 2026-05-09
```

That test was not written.

### §2.5 Why the AG-WIRE / AG-FRESH gates didn't catch this

Existing CI gates check Author-Gate hook wiring and packet shape (per memories `f220bb61`, `6e7e9afe`). They are governance gates, not capability gates. They cannot detect "the runtime cannot be imported".

There is no CI gate that asserts:
- Every `apps_*` package has an importable `__init__.py`
- Every `apps_*` package has a runnable `python -m apps_<x> --dry-run`
- Every `apps_*` package has a `runner-instantiable` smoke test

This plan adds those.

### §2.6 Lessons learned (for plan §6 Definition-of-Done discipline)

| # | Lesson | Mechanism in this plan |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Negative-pattern tests are necessary but insufficient for completeness | W5 introduces capability smoke tests as DoD |
| L2 | Quarantine without replacement = orphan code; both must land in the same wave | W2/W3 land replacement before any new quarantine |
| L3 | Plan close-out must include an end-to-end "smoke proof" — at minimum `import x` and `python -m x --dry-run` | W5 establishes; W6 codifies as universal apps_* DoD |
| L4 | "Tests passing" alone is insufficient evidence — must publish what tests cover | W6 introduces test-coverage taxonomy in DoD |
| L5 | Plan §18 deferred-scope must list every known gap; absence implies "complete and verified" | W6 introduces verification-vs-deferral distinction in plan template |

---

## §3. Objective

1. Land the W5/W6/W7 wiring claimed by `c8b3e1` so `python -m apps_rg` produces a real resume artifact end-to-end.
2. Codify Definition-of-Done discipline preventing this class of premature plan closure for any future apps_* refactor.

---

## §4. Non-Goals

- Re-quarantine or de-quarantine any file outside `apps_rg/__init__.py` (already minimally repaired this session)
- Modify the AG-RGGOV-8 quarantine boundary
- Add real Gemini SDK wiring (deferred per `c8b3e1` §18)
- Implement L3 `MANAGED_WORKFLOW` (deferred per `c8b3e1` §18)
- Wire `apps_rg` profile UWG promotion to L4 (deferred per `c8b3e1` §18)
- Replicate this pattern to sibling apps (`apps_lic`, `apps_qna`, etc.) — each is its own plan
- Modify the `AppsRgIngressPayload` schema
- Touch the existing 15 bypass tests (governance-correct as-is)

## §8. ADG_HOTSPOT_REPORT

| Hotspot | File | Layer | Fan-in | Fan-out | Archetype | Surface intersection | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AppIngressRunner | `agentic_core/runtime/entry/app_ingress_runner.py` | L0/runtime entry | HIGH (every apps_*) | LOW (single class) | CENTRAL_DEPENDENCY | Execution + Security + Observability | HIGH — `.run()` extension touches every app |
| apps_rg `__main__.py` | `apps_rg/__main__.py` | apps_rg/ingress | LOW (entry only) | HIGH (consumes core pipeline) | ORCHESTRATOR | Execution | HIGH — entry point for the entire app |
| U0 ingress validator | `agentic_core/runtime/entry/u0_*` | L0/security | HIGH (every app's request) | LOW | SAFETY_GATEKEEPER | Security + Execution | HIGH — authority-validation chokepoint |
| L1/L0 bindings | `agentic_core/L{1,0}_*/apps_rg_*_binding.py` | L1/L0 | LOW (apps_rg only) | MED | STATE_NODE | Execution + State | MED — task-class-specific glue |
| L2/Exit bindings | `agentic_core/L2_execution/apps_rg_*`, `runtime/exit/apps_rg_*` | L2/Exit | LOW | MED | STATE_NODE | Execution + Write + Observability | MED — execution + disposition emit |

Layer multipliers per `adg-canonical-invariants.md`:
- L0 (×2.0) — AppIngressRunner extension is highest-risk
- L5 — N/A (no safety changes)
- L3 — N/A (managed workflow deferred per c8b3e1 §18)
- L1/L2 (×1.0) — task-class bindings
- L6 (×0.75) — observability via OTEL spans, lower weight

5 Surfaces touched: **Execution** (the entire pipeline), **Write** (Exit emits state-write request — L4 deferred per §18), **Security** (U0 authority validation), **State** (L1/L0 contracts), **Observability** (OTEL span chain U0→L1→L0→[C0]→[PA]→L2→Exit per c8b3e1 §10).

## §9. ADG_GRAPH_LAYER_EVIDENCE

This is **simultaneously a runtime-completion plan AND a process-discipline plan**. The runtime portion (W2–W5) IS in agentic_core ADG scope; the discipline portion (W6) is infrastructure.

### 9.1 Materialized views (≥3 required)

1. **`mv_graph_reverse_dependency_hotspots`** — `AppIngressRunner` will surface as a new high-fan-in node once the `.run()` method is consumed by sibling apps. This plan establishes the pattern that drives that fan-in.
2. **`mv_graph_chokepoint_bridges`** — U0 ingress validator IS the chokepoint between apps_* and core runtime. This plan formalizes the bridge.
3. **`mv_dependency_cone_risk`** — `apps_rg/__main__.py` cone is currently 0 (broken at import); this plan restores it to the documented W5 architecture.

### 9.2 Semantic edges (`flows_to`, `emits_side_effect`, `controls_flow`, `resolves_callsite`, `reads_from`, `writes_to`)

```
apps_rg.__main__.main
  ├─ flows_to → AppsRgIngressPayload (constructor)

  │                           └─ emits_side_effect → OTEL span chain (L6)
```

### 9.3 P-views

- **`v_p0_*`** — apps_rg currently exhibits a P0 layer break: `apps_rg.__init__` imported a module that raises (P0 critical-layer-break-equivalent). Repaired this session. Plan ensures no further P0 violations introduced.
- **`v_p1_*`** — quarantined files raising RuntimeError fall under "mis-layered/zero-caller infra". Plan does not de-quarantine; uses parallel core bindings instead.

| DoD-9 | Plan §2 RCA published as ADR or runtime_cert report | `docs/reports/runtime_cert/apps_rg_w0_w9_rca.md` exists + linked from this plan |
| DoD-10 | 3 new CI gates registered + advisory-passing | `run_contract_gates.py` includes APPS-IMPORT, APPS-DRYRUN, PLAN-DOD |

**No "Completed" status without all 10 boxes ticked.** This was the single biggest discipline gap in c8b3e1.

## §11. Test Surface

| Test file | New cases | Type | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tests/_apps_contract/test_apps_rg_smoke_capability.py` | ~6 | capability smoke | All pass — positive assertions inverse to bypass tests |
| `tests/_apps_contract/test_apps_rg_dry_run.py` | ~4 | dry-run smoke | All pass — `--dry-run` produces valid JSON, exit 0 |
| `tests/_apps_contract/test_apps_rg_runner_instantiable.py` | ~3 | instantiation | `AppIngressRunner.run` exists; instantiates with apps_rg dispatch |
| `tests/_apps_contract/test_apps_rg_e2e_resume_generation.py` | ~2 | e2e (`@pytest.mark.e2e`) | Skipped if `VLLM_BASE_URL` unset; otherwise produces valid `generated_resume.json` |
| `tests/unit/agentic_core/runtime/entry/test_app_ingress_runner_run_method.py` | ~8 | unit | Method dispatch correctness; payload validation; ExitDisposition shape |
| `tests/unit/agentic_core/runtime/entry/test_apps_rg_dispatch.py` | ~10 | unit | Each of dispatch/parse/required_fields tested |
| `tests/unit/agentic_core/L1_cognition/test_apps_rg_l1_binding.py` | ~5 | unit | L1PlanContract emit shape |
| `tests/unit/agentic_core/L0_routing/test_apps_rg_l0_binding.py` | ~5 | unit | RouteContract emit + execution_form |
| `tests/unit/ops_scripts/ci/test_check_apps_package_importable.py` | ~6 | CI gate | Detects broken `__init__.py`; bypass env var |
| `tests/unit/ops_scripts/ci/test_check_apps_dry_run_works.py` | ~6 | CI gate | Detects missing `--dry-run` support |
| `tests/unit/ops_scripts/ci/test_check_plan_completion_dod.py` | ~6 | CI gate | Detects plans marked Completed without DoD section |
| Existing 15 bypass tests | 0 new | regression | All still pass |

**Total new tests:** ~61 · zero existing tests modified.

## §12. Bypass + Escape Hatches

| Env var | Effect | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `APPS_PACKAGE_IMPORT_BYPASS=1` | Importable gate emits warning row instead of failing | Scripted batch runs |
| `APPS_DRY_RUN_BYPASS=1` | Dry-run gate advisory-only | Same |
| `PLAN_DOD_BYPASS=1` | Plan DoD gate advisory-only for plans created before this plan | Backward-compat for existing plans |
| `APPS_RG_E2E_SKIP=1` | Skip E2E test (no vLLM available) | CI on minimal environments |

All bypasses durably logged.

## §13. AG_QUEUE_SEED — Anticipated Author-Gate Decisions

```
AG_QUEUE_SEED: plan=apps-rg-runtime-wiring-completion-d4e8a1 id=ARW-1 depends_on= title=Where to put apps_rg-specific dispatch — agentic_core/runtime/entry/apps_rg_dispatch.py vs apps_rg/dispatch.py (would re-introduce runtime authority) vs core/runtime/entry/dispatchers/apps_rg.py (subdir taxonomy)
AG_QUEUE_SEED: plan=apps-rg-runtime-wiring-completion-d4e8a1 id=ARW-2 depends_on=ARW-1 title=Dispatch return shape — direct ExitDisposition vs AsyncIterator[StageProgress] (streaming) vs RunRecord (full receipt)
AG_QUEUE_SEED: plan=apps-rg-runtime-wiring-completion-d4e8a1 id=ARW-3 depends_on= title=Where to publish RCA — docs/reports/runtime_cert/ (existing precedent) vs docs/architecture/adr/ADR-NNN.md (architectural decision) vs both
AG_QUEUE_SEED: plan=apps-rg-runtime-wiring-completion-d4e8a1 id=ARW-4 depends_on= title=L3 deferral — single SINGLE_STEP route only (per c8b3e1 §18) vs minimal MANAGED_WORKFLOW for multi-hop narrative pass
AG_QUEUE_SEED: plan=apps-rg-runtime-wiring-completion-d4e8a1 id=ARW-5 depends_on= title=DoD enforcement — advisory CI gate (PLAN-DOD) only vs blocking pre-commit hook on plan close-out
```
