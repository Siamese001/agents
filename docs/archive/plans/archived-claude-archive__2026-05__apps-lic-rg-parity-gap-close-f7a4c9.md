# apps_lic → apps_rg golden-state parity (gap analysis rollout)

Close governed-runtime proof gaps for `apps_lic` identified in `apps_lic_vs_apps_rg_gap_analysis.md` (archive audit), prioritized W0-first: unblock monorepo runtime, then SSOT contracts, real L2, canonical gates/Exit, evidence chain, and L6/X1D/99 proof.

> **plan_id discipline**: Filename stem matches `plan_id`. Markers use `plan=apps-lic-rg-parity-gap-close-f7a4c9`.

## Context (SCQA)

- **Situation** — An external/uploaded `apps_lic` archive shows substantial domain assets (U0 adapter, profiles, FEC bridge, PA compiler, managed workflow, judges scaffolding) but was audited **without** `agentic_core`, `apps_rg`, `tests/_apps_contract`, or CI scripts.
- **Complication** — Integrated runtime smoke fails (`No module named 'agentic_core'`); ingress, route SSOT, L2, gates, Exit/X3, C0 proof, judges, L6 chain, and contract tests are not yet golden-state certified.
- **Question** — How do we systematically close parity gaps **in the full monorepo** while preserving architecture law (apps own ingress/profiles; core stays generic)?
- **Answer** — Execute in waves: prove runtime spine end-to-end, collapse route policy SSOT, harden L2 and gate/Exit receipts, strengthen evidence/PA proofs, then X1D/L6/99 closure with contract gates—deferring core renames unless a boundary audit confirms leakage.

## Out Of Scope (this plan cycle)

- Broad `agentic_core` refactors (only file **CORE_GAP_CANDIDATES** after ADG/boundary audit user authorizes core work).
- Renaming shared types solely for cosmetics without leakage proof (`LIC-GAP-012`).
- Completing judge promotion without human/adjudicated labels (`LIC-GAP-009`).
- Implementing GraphRAG/C0 traversal while `CONFIG_PREPARED_ONLY`—must be explicit deferral unless product demands.

---

## Wave 1 — Runtime unblock + U0 parity

WAVE_ID: W1  
WAVE_STATUS: TODO  
WAVE_COMPLETE: NO  
AUTHORIZATION_STATUS: NOT_REQUIRED  
CHECKPOINT: A

**Phases**: P1.1 · P1.2 · P1.3  

**Acceptance**:

- LIC-GAP-001 cleared: CLI run with monorepo `PYTHONPATH`/`uv`/project venv emits non-failure spine or honest R5 with captured artifacts.
- LIC-GAP-002 cleared: ingress path conforms to `AppsLicIngressContractV1` before U0 adaptation.
- Proof directory lists `validated_request`, route decision, PA artifact reference, L2 outcome (success or bounded failure), Exit packet stub/progress toward X3 chain.

---

## Wave 2 — Route policy SSOT

WAVE_ID: W2  
WAVE_STATUS: TODO  
WAVE_COMPLETE: NO  
AUTHORIZATION_STATUS: NOT_REQUIRED  
CHECKPOINT: B

**Phases**: P2.1 · P2.2  

**Acceptance**:

- LIC-GAP-003 cleared: domain_contract route profile wins; YAML/static duplicates updated, quarantined, or flagged `deprecated` with CI guard if needed.
- Final personalized drafts bypass R1A/R1B per policy; governed cache only for allowed support artifacts.

---

## Wave 3 — L2 execution + sealing

WAVE_ID: W3  
WAVE_STATUS: TODO  
WAVE_COMPLETE: NO  
AUTHORIZATION_STATUS: NOT_REQUIRED  
CHECKPOINT: C

**Phases**: P3.1 · P3.2 · P3.3  

**Acceptance**:

- LIC-GAP-004 cleared: remove synthetic `_e5_l2_receipt` / `test_l2_receipt` class behaviors; validate manifest, claims, placeholders, send mode; real provider call or DOCUMENTED block.
- LIC-GAP-013 cleared: clarify CommitRequest semantics; negative tests forbid direct send/write off-spine paths.

---

## Wave 4 — Canonical gates + Exit X3

WAVE_ID: W4  
WAVE_STATUS: TODO  
WAVE_COMPLETE: NO  
AUTHORIZATION_STATUS: NOT_REQUIRED  
CHECKPOINT: D

**Phases**: P4.1 · P4.2  

**Acceptance**:

- LIC-GAP-005/006 cleared: adapters produce/consume canonical gate mesh receipts; UNKNOWN never PASS; Exit emits exactly one X3-compatible disposition + user-visible packet.

---

## Wave 5 — Evidence (C0/FEC) + PA

WAVE_ID: W5  
WAVE_STATUS: TODO  
WAVE_COMPLETE: NO  
AUTHORIZATION_STATUS: NOT_REQUIRED  
CHECKPOINT: E

**Phases**: P5.1 · P5.2  

**Acceptance**:

- LIC-GAP-007 cleared: FEC or research bridge proves citations/ACL/freshness/version; graph adapter either live or explicitly “not runtime-ready.”
- LIC-GAP-008 cleared: unresolved template placeholders cause hard rejection with tests.

---

## Wave 6 — X1D, L6, 99 bundle, CI

WAVE_ID: W6  
WAVE_STATUS: TODO  
WAVE_COMPLETE: NO  
AUTHORIZATION_STATUS: NOT_REQUIRED  
CHECKPOINT: F

**Phases**: P6.1 · P6.2 · P6.3  

**Acceptance**:

- LIC-GAP-009: deterministic judges wired; LLM judges remain non-promoted until labels exist (document expectation).
- LIC-GAP-010: completed-run-only L6 chain artifacts present (`RuntimeExhaustBundle` → `CompletedEvalRecord` → inert proposals).
- LIC-GAP-011: selective `pytest` under `tests/_apps_contract/` + app smoke scripted in CI or local gate doc.

|----|----------:|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| LIC-GAP-001 | BLOCKER | REQUIRED_PARITY | No integrated runtime without core | Monorepo smoke + artifact bundle |

| LIC-GAP-003 | HIGH | REQUIRED_PARITY | Route SSOT contradiction | Profile collapse + route tests |
| LIC-GAP-004 | CRITICAL | REQUIRED_PARITY | L2 TODOs / synthetic seal | Real seal path + provider |
| LIC-GAP-005 | HIGH | REQUIRED_PARITY | Missing GateVerdict/GateMesh in archive audit | Wire canonical gate receipts |
| LIC-GAP-006 | HIGH | REQUIRED_PARITY | Exit vocab vs X3 | Mapping or native spine packet |
| LIC-GAP-007 | HIGH | DOMAIN_ADAPTATION | FEC bridge without live Golden C0 proof | Evidence contract + citations |
| LIC-GAP-008 | MEDIUM | DOMAIN_ADAPTATION | PA placeholder enforcement | Negative tests |
| LIC-GAP-009 | HIGH | DOMAIN_ADAPTATION | Judges blocked / unstubs | Labels + calibration gating |
| LIC-GAP-010 | HIGH | REQUIRED_PARITY | L6 chain absent | Completed-run ingest only |
| LIC-GAP-011 | HIGH | REQUIRED_PARITY | No tests in upload | Repo contract tests |
| LIC-GAP-012 | MEDIUM | CORE_GAP_CANDIDATE | `AppsRgIngressPayload` naming in apps_lic | ADG audit before any core rename |
| LIC-GAP-013 | HIGH | REQUIRED_PARITY | UWG/commit clarity | Negative controls + docs in Exit path |

## Definition of Done

| DoD | Criterion | Evidence command / artifact |
|-----|-----------|-----------------------------|
| DoD-1 | End-to-end `apps_lic` run exits 0 in monorepo with captured spine artifacts | `python -m apps_lic ...` + artifact dir listing |
| DoD-2 | Route/cache behavior matches finalized domain contract | Targeted pytest on route + cache bypass |
| DoD-3 | L2 produces non-synthetic sealed outcome or bounded failure | Unit/integration tests on `lic_l2_step_adapters` |
| DoD-4 | Gates + Exit: UNKNOWN never PASS; one X3 | Gate/exit pytest or runtime bundle fields |
| DoD-5 | Contract/regression subset green | `python -m pytest tests/_apps_contract/<selectors> -q` |
| DoD-6 | L6 only post-run; learning artifacts deterministic | pytest for exhaust → eval → proposal path |

### Verification vs deferral

| Topic | Verified in-repo | Deferred (explicit marker) |
|-------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Full GraphRAG / C0 traverse | FEC + apps_research path | `c0_graph_adapter` CONFIG_ONLY until chartered |
| LLM judge promotion | Deterministic judges on path | Promotion until Spearman/human labels |
| Core type rename (`AppsRgIngressPayload`) | Boundary audit dossier | No core edits without charter |
