# Semantic Gap Analysis Dashboard

## Executive Summary

**Analysis Date:** March 5, 2026
**Total Files Analyzed:** ~2,600 Python files
**Total Gaps:** 1,239
**Critical Issues:** 598 HIGH priority gaps

---

## Key Findings Overview

### 🚨 Critical Infrastructure Missing
- **write_gateway.py** - Sole durable mutation authority
- **meta_learning_pipeline.py** - Immutable stage ordering system

### 🔓 Sovereignty Violations
- **Direct Provider Imports:** Multiple files bypassing SovereignLLMGateway
- **Upward Import Dependencies:** Cross-layer coupling violations
- **Non-L2 Mutations:** Write operations outside execution choke point

### 🏛️ Governance Gaps
- **Missing Governance Stamps:** No Compliance Hash/InstructionPacket evidence
- **Airlock Contract Gaps:** Missing SandboxEnvelope validation
- **JIT Sync Issues:** No SemanticClock/CapabilityToken markers

### 📊 Prompt Taxonomy Issues
- **Slot Coverage:** Only 1/9 assemblers have complete S0/D0/I0/C0/U0
- **Missing Manifests:** No manifest hash evidence in most assemblers
- **Boundary Snapshots:** No pre-flight validation evidence

### 🔍 Informational Boundary Violations
- **Embedding Placement:** 598 HIGH priority violations in control paths
- **FAISS Operations:** Outside RAG/provider seams
- **C0 Guarantees:** Eroding informational-only boundaries

## Conclusion

The semantic gap analysis reveals significant architectural debt that threatens system sovereignty, governance, and performance. However, with systematic execution of this remediation plan, we can achieve a fully compliant and optimized agentic architecture within 12 weeks.

Regular monitoring and continuous gap analysis will ensure we maintain architectural integrity as the system evolves.
