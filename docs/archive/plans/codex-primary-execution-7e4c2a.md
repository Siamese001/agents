# Codex Primary Execution

Promote Codex from backup-only wording to the primary local execution surface while keeping repo-owned governance files as the rule source of truth.

## Context (SCQA)

- **Situation** - Codex can run repo work and now has callable Memory, GitKraken, and Vector DB surfaces in-session, but repo docs still describe it as a primary adapter.
- **Complication** - Claude API rate limits make Claude-first execution brittle, while stale Codex MCP evidence can push agents into degraded fallbacks even when live tools are callable.
- **Question** - How do we make Codex the practical execution SSOT without creating a second governance registry?
- **Answer** - Add a Codex-primary contract, executable readiness checks, run receipt validation, a refreshed live MCP snapshot, and advisory-only local Codex skill checks while preserving repo-owned files as versioned governance inputs during migration.

## Status Tables

### Wave Progress

| Wave | Phase IDs | Focus | Est. Tokens | Assumptions | Status | Success Criteria |
|------|-----------|-------|-------------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| W1 | W1.1, W1.2 | Contract and plan | ~4K | Existing `.codex` rules remain repo-owned governance inputs. | DONE | Primary contract and AGENTS/doc pointers exist. |
| W2 | W2.1, W2.2 | Readiness and receipts | ~8K | Shell-side scripts cannot directly introspect Codex MCP tools, so callable proof can be supplied by env/status evidence. | DONE | Readiness and receipt validators pass focused unit tests. |
| W3 | W3.1, W3.2 | Evidence refresh and verification | ~5K | MCP reports are evidence snapshots, not routing registries. | DONE | Live snapshot documents callable/degraded routes and governance checks pass. |
| W4 | W4.1, W4.2 | Local skill dependency cleanup | ~4K | Personal Codex skills are workstation bootstrap shims, not repo governance SSOT. | DONE | Compatibility verifier no longer hard-fails on missing personal skills by default. |
| W5 | W5.1, W5.2 | Follow-up docs and verification | ~4K | Primary verifier remains repo-only. | DONE | Docs, tests, receipt, and plan reflect advisory skill behavior. |

## Out Of Scope

- Rewriting `.codex` rule bodies into Codex-specific skills.
- Changing credentials, MCP secrets, or provider API keys.
- Removing Claude compatibility files in this pass.
- Solving raw DeepWiki or ADG MCP host exposure if the Codex host does not expose those tools.

- **W4.2** - Preserve strict bootstrap audit flag | ~2K tokens | PHASE_STATUS: DONE | PHASE_COMPLETE: YES

**Acceptance**:
- `scripts/governance/verify_codex_primary.py` passes by default when repo anchors are valid even if personal Codex skills are absent.
- `--require-personal-skills` preserves hard-fail behavior for workstation bootstrap audits.
- `--repo-only` still suppresses personal-skill checks entirely for CI.

## Execution Details

### W1.1 - Add Codex Primary Contract
**Scope**: Create a repo-owned contract that makes Codex primary for local execution state, readiness, receipts, and verification.

**Commands**:
```bash
python scripts/governance/verify_codex_primary.py
```

### W2.1 - Add Codex Readiness Gate
**Scope**: Implement a read-only preflight that composes git cleanliness, transport audit output, MCP route evidence, path-budget script presence, and process hygiene.

**Commands**:
```bash
python scripts/governance/codex_readiness.py --json
```

### W2.2 - Add Run Receipt Validator
**Scope**: Define a JSON run receipt contract and validate status, files changed, checks, commands, fallbacks, and RCA on failures.

**Commands**:
```bash
python scripts/governance/verify_codex_run_receipt.py <receipt.json>
```

### W4.1 - Make Personal Skills Advisory
**Scope**: Change the legacy compatibility verifier so personal Codex skill drift is advisory by default.

**Commands**:
```bash
python scripts/governance/verify_codex_primary.py
```

### W4.2 - Preserve Strict Bootstrap Audit
**Scope**: Keep strict failure behavior available when explicitly auditing the workstation bootstrap layer.

**Commands**:
```bash
python scripts/governance/verify_codex_primary.py --require-personal-skills
```

## Gap Register

**GAP-1: Codex host MCP discovery is not available to shell scripts**
- Details: Python scripts cannot see the agent's live tool namespace.
- Impact: Callable MCP proof must be passed through environment/status evidence or recorded snapshots.

**GAP-2: Raw ADG and DeepWiki MCPs are not callable in the current Codex session**
- Details: Live discovery did not expose those tool namespaces.
- Impact: ADG must use a named degraded SQLite fallback until host exposure is repaired.
