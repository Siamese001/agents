HEADLINE_RUBRIC = """
You are evaluating a single resume headline formatted exactly as: SVP Engineering | X | Y | Z
(space-pipe-space separators; exactly four segments; first segment exactly "SVP Engineering"; 10-13 total words).
Return JSON only with: score_scale, score, threshold, pass, decisive_failure, findings, cited_sentence_indexes, remediation_suggestions.

Score contract:
- score_scale must be "0_to_1" or "0_to_5" only.

Rubric dimensions:
1. factual_support: every substantive phrase in X/Y/Z is supported by claim_ledger source_fact_ids present in allowed_fact_packet. Treat every ID explicitly present there as eligible, including graph-era reb_* role-episode roots and skill_* nodes as well as bul_*, fact_*, and metric-suffixed IDs. Never use an ID prefix as a reason to reject evidence that the packet explicitly allows; JD/briefing/target fields remain targeting-only and never proof.
2. fixed_prefix_compliance: headline_line starts with "SVP Engineering | " and uses exactly three " | " separators.
3. base_identity_fidelity: authentic to the base resume headline anchor; not rewritten to chase the JD.
4. anti_keyword_stuffing: no ATS keyword bags, list-like segments, or semantically redundant variants of the same positioning theme across X/Y/Z.
5. JD targeting discipline: JD relevance without copying JD phrasing or treating JD as authority; preserve senior platform, governance, and runtime signals; ask whether a Head of Talent Acquisition at the target company would forward it.
6. executive_authenticity: reads as a senior platform/engineering leader, not generic leadership filler or juniorized IT labeling; no AI-authenticity dead giveaways such as em dashes, buzzword soup, template cadence, or machine-generated phrasing.
7. no_title_inflation: first segment is not replaced or subverted; no "SVP at TargetCo" framing.
8. natural human resume sound: concise, human, resume-native phrasing; each segment should add a distinct signal, not a synonym, and the whole line should survive a skeptical TA screen.

Adversarial review lens:
- Head of Talent Acquisition pass: would a recruiter at the target company forward it in one read?
- AI authenticity pass: no em dashes, no buzzword soup, no template phrasing, no generic AI tells.

Decisive failure triggers (if any, set decisive_failure true and pass false):
- missing fixed prefix "SVP Engineering" as segment 1
- not exactly four non-empty segments or not exactly three " | " separators
- word count outside 10-13 (inclusive)
- unsupported proof relative to claim_ledger / resume facts
- employer names, target company names, or candidate personal name tokens
- metrics or numeric proof in headline_line
- first person
- semantically redundant X/Y/Z segments that collapse to the same concept
- generic IT labels or demoting terms that blunt SVP-level positioning
- copied JD phrases or briefing-only / JD-only claims without fact support
- would not pass a Head of Talent Acquisition screen
- AI-authenticity dead giveaways such as em dashes, buzzword soup, or machine-generated cadence
