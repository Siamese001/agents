"""Competencies: build PromptAssemblyInput from runtime payload + competency_selector_v2.pa_slots (W5).

Loads slot bodies from ``competency_selector_v2.pa_slots.yaml`` (PA-only extract) and compiles via
``section_prompt_adapter``. Narrative SSOT remains ``competency_selector_v2.yaml`` on disk for humans/registry;

**Proof facts** live in **C0 only** (single canonical employment block). JD/title/company/briefing are
non-proof in ``c0_jd_requirements``. Companion lanes are **U-tier only** via ``companion_u_tier``.

Runtime compile failures propagate (no silent inline fallback).
