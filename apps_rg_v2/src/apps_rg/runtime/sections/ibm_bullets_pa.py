"""IBM bullets: PA compile via section_prompt_adapter.

W1 (Bullet Proof Bundle Redesign): IBM now uses ORGANIC_FROM_GRAPH_BUNDLE treatment.
C0 emits GRAPH_BULLET_EVIDENCE_PACK with bound_skills + proof_atoms (mechanism_vocab,
locked_metrics, domain). claim_text prose is never injected into C0.

        "do not under-surface approved graph metrics. Metrics allowed only when bound to "

        "Forbidden: unapproved held-value, overload, ARR, or generic cost-savings metrics.\n"
        "METRIC SURFACING (PROMOTABLE metrics only): when a bullet's selected_fact_plan fact has "
        "has_metric=true AND its metric binds a promotable metric_outcome_id, the bullet_text MUST "
        "literally include that metric token, inside the SAME single sentence (never append the metric "
        "as a second sentence). Do NOT write a qualitative bullet that drops its own approved metric. "
        "Example: a slot bound to metric_ibm_20pct_joint_revenue_growth must state '20%'; "
        "a slot bound to metric_ibm_stress_test_cycle_weeks_to_hours must state 'weeks to hours'. "
        "This rule NEVER applies to forbidden/HOLD figures: even if a fact carries one, "
        "write that bullet qualitatively with NO numeric figure. "
        "Mirror promotable metric_raw figures exactly; set has_metric=true and bind metric_outcome_ids.\n"
        "QUALITY FLOOR: before returning each bullet, verify it states (1) a specific executive action, "
        "(2) a named delivery detail, and (3) an evidence-backed business, adoption, risk, or delivery "
        "result. A capability-only statement such as a framework, service, or platform with no result is "
        "invalid and will be rejected.\n"
        "GATED-METRIC BAN: NEVER emit a metric whose outcome_id is only *_gated / unconfirmed. "
        "If a savings/efficiency figure is not bound to a confirmed promotable metric_outcome_id, "
        "write that bullet qualitatively with NO numeric figure.\n"
        "PER-SLOT COMPOSITION BINDING: each bul_ibm_NNN bullet_text MUST restate the core activity of "
        "ITS OWN graph_bundle_story from IBM_ROLE_EPISODE_EVIDENCE_PACK. NEVER borrow another "
        "slot's activity, technology, or metric; "
        "NEVER lift a metric from SKILL_PHRASE_CAPSULE guidance — capsule phrases are vocabulary, not claims. "
        "EXACTLY ONE sentence per bullet (one terminal period at the very end — never two sentences). "
        "Every bullet names at least one concrete mechanism, platform, or technology. "
        "No first person; no em dash; no inline source tags; no narrative paragraph; max 4 consecutive JD words. "
        "Cite ONLY bul_ibm_* ids — never reference any non-IBM id anywhere in the output (bullets, claim_ledger, "

        "IBM story (career-phase truth): cloud modernization, AWS/hyperscaler engineering, ML/analytics "

        "commercial engagement (technical pre-sales, client portfolio growth, alliance "
        "revenue). Write each bullet to ITS OWN slot fact's story: a GTM/pre-sales fact yields a "
        "commercial-engineering bullet (do NOT recast it as pure platform delivery); a platform fact yields "
        "a platform bullet. Regulatory lineage (Basel/CCAR) belongs to the EY phase — NOT the IBM story. "
