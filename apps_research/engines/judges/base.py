"""Base judge infrastructure for apps_research W9 judges.

W9 Scope:
- claim support judge
- citation quality judge
- coverage depth judge
- contradiction resolution judge
- source authority judge
- cache compatibility judge
- briefing injection judge
- downstream relevance judges for apps_rg/apps_lic
- deterministic graders
- mapping judge/eval results into G09, G10, G22, G25 evidence

W9 Constraints:
- Do NOT change Exit X3 logic
- Do NOT write cache
- Do NOT add L6 learning
- Do NOT add UWG writeback
- Do NOT let judges directly decide X3
