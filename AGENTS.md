# Agent Guidance — Agentic-Workflow

## Plan First. Execute Second.

Root AGENTS.md is the primary agent execution adapter. Repo governance, rules, and skills live under .agents/ and .antigravity/.

**T2/T3** (2+ files, cross-layer, architecture, multi-file debug): enter native plan mode and present the plan for approval before any edit. Use the `structured-reasoning` skill only as decomposition / retrieval guidance inside that plan-mode workflow. See `.agents/rules/plan-first-enforcement.md`.

**T0/T1**: single file ≤20 lines or questions — answer/edit directly.

**Layer separation:** Reasoning / Routing / Execution / Verification — no edits before plan approval.

## Wave Refactoring Protocol

Before performing refactoring work, read and follow:

`docs/refactoring-wave-protocol.md`

Required behavior:

- Execute only the currently approved wave.
- Make the smallest sufficient change.
- Preserve behavior not explicitly targeted.
- Do not perform unrelated cleanup or later-wave work.
- Obtain human-in-the-loop approval before any material scope deviation.
- Stop and raise a deviation request when the approved objective cannot be
  completed safely without expanding scope.
- Validate the wave before claiming completion.
- Place optional findings in the subsequent-refactoring backlog.
- Complete the core objective within no more than six waves.
- Treat `docs/refactoring-wave-protocol.md` as the authoritative protocol.

## MCP Quick Reference

> Stable IDs are the `mcpServers` keys in root `.mcp.json` (repo MCP SSOT). Live tool prefixes like `mcp0_`, `mcp1_`, and so on can shift when server order changes. Resolve the live prefix from the current tool list in-session.

<!-- MCP-QUICK-REFERENCE:START -->

<!-- MCP-QUICK-REFERENCE:END -->

Server-specific MCP procedures are indexed by [mcp-integration](.agents/skills/mcp-integration/SKILL.md) sections §1–§13. `adg-sqlite` remains the dedicated structural-analysis skill.

Procedural routing + manual-Notion-use note: [agents-tier1-companion.md](.agents/skills/mcp-integration/agents-tier1-companion.md). (Notion plan-status / wave / registration enforcement removed — `notion-wave-enforcement-removal`.)

## Memory

At session start, load native file memory from `memory/MEMORY.md`. For non-trivial work, also read `memory/codex/memory_summary.md` when Codex-specific run history, branch workflow memory, or repo-specific Codex skills could affect the task.

The knowledge-graph Memory MCP is optional for graph queries or writeback when its transport is healthy; if it fails, continue from file memory and do not retry-loop on the transport. Treat external global memories as user memory only; do not make them the SSOT for Agentic Workflow project memory.

## Constitutional floor

- Subprocess timeout always required — `subprocess.run(argv, shell=False, timeout=30)`. PowerShell is allowed as the primary Windows shell when commands remain bounded.
- No `pytest.mark.skip` without `strict=True`
- No bare `except Exception` without guardian
- No edits during planning phase
- ADG before grep for structure (§28); grep for literals/TODOs only
- Full rules: `AGENTS.md` + `docs/codex-primary-execution.md` · expanded lists: legacy compatibility notes only

## Plans

Lookup: `.agents/rules/codex-config-lookup.md` and `.agents/rules/plan-location.md`. New plans are disk-only under `plans/<name>-<6hex>.md`; `.codex/plans/` is an archive of migrated historical plans, not the write target for new work.

## Pytest

Pytest runs with plugin **autoload ON** (CI default); `addopts` carries `--timeout=180` but no `-p pytest_timeout`. **Do NOT** set `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1` for ad-hoc runs — it strips pytest-timeout and `--timeout` aborts collection. See companion for the duplicate-registration caveat (don't add `-p pytest_timeout` either).

## Core vs apps (summary)

Apps customize inputs; core enforces contracts. No app leakage in `agentic_core` without migration receipt. **Multi-provider X1D proof panels:** `agentic_core/runtime/judges/panel/` (`JudgePanelRunner`, transport preflight); `apps_rg` wires adapters via `x1d_panel_bridge` (see plan [core-judge-panel-harness-f3c8d1](plans/core-judge-panel-harness-f3c8d1.md)). Detail: [`agentic_core/AGENTS.md`](agentic_core/AGENTS.md) · `.codex/rules/agentic-core-static.md` (legacy reference only).

## Rules & Skills SSOT

Procedural MCP / Notion / ledgers: `scripts/governance/**`, `.codex/**`, and `docs/reports/codex/**` cover the active Codex flow. Plan location (disk-only): [`plan-location.md`](.agents/rules/plan-location.md).

| Layer | Path | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Always-on rules | `AGENTS.md` + `docs/codex-primary-execution.md` | Active Codex governance contract and rule floor |
| On-demand rules | `.codex/rules/*.md` + `scripts/governance/**` | Load by task surface and file scope |
| Skills | `.codex/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Repo-owned Codex procedural adapters |
| Hooks | `.codex/hooks.json` + `.codex/hooks/**` | Native Codex hook registry and hook entrypoints |
| Index | `docs/reports/codex/` + historical rule-index references | Generated route evidence and historical references only |
| Deprecated compatibility shims | docs/archive and `_legacy_*` shims | Non-authoritative compatibility/archive only; edit Codex-owned files |

**Dedup:** Do not restate always-on invariants in compatibility stubs or hook reminders. Active procedure lives in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/codex-primary-execution.md`; retired rule and skill names remain historical only.

Governance inventory: [`governance_tier_inventory.json`](docs/reports/cursor/governance_tier_inventory.json) · dedup audit: [`governance_dedup_audit_20260526.md`](docs/reports/cursor/governance_dedup_audit_20260526.md) · closeout plan: [`governance-dedup-closeout-e8a4c2.md`](plans/governance-dedup-closeout-e8a4c2.md).

## Antigravity Execution Adapter

Google Antigravity is the primary execution surface for this repository. Repo-owned governance assets live under .agents and .antigravity:

- Active rule sets live in .agents/rules/*.md.
- Active skills live in .agents/skills/*/SKILL.md.
- Active MCP server configuration is maintained in root .mcp.json and .agents/mcp_config.json.
- Workspace runtime boundaries and path containment policies live in .antigravity/runtime-boundary.json.
- Plans are disk-only under plans/<name>-<6hex>.md.
