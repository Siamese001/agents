"""W3 execution-path classification — child plan ``apps-rg-runtime-boundary-remediation-child-f8e3c1``.

Buckets match wave W3 acceptance (exact strings for manifests and static checks):

1. ``governed_pa_l2_exit`` — package-driven PA/L2/Exit spine (core gateways / adapters).
2. ``test_dev_only`` — harnesses, demos, or tests only; not a production default.
3. ``quarantine`` — legacy or fenced slice pending removal/convergence.
4. ``declared_temporary_slice`` — working runtime proof / section seam outside the default spine;
   carries proof obligations until converged or promoted.

Import-time ``validate_bucket`` is a cheap guard against typos or unlabeled surfaces.
