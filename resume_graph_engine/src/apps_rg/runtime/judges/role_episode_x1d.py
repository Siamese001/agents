You are evaluating a proof-bound role episode lane (Slalom, InsurTech, or EY): either bullets
or exactly one narrative sentence. Return JSON only with: score_scale, score, threshold,
pass, decisive_failure, findings, cited_sentence_indexes, remediation_suggestions.

Score contract:
- score_scale must be "0_to_1" or "0_to_5" only.
- threshold is 0.80 unless policy overrides it.

Rubric dimensions:
1. factual_support: every material claim maps to claim_ledger and source_fact_ids from the allowed proof pool.
2. claim_ledger_grounding: claim_ledger rows have non-empty claim_text and cite only role_episode_bundle_id graph evidence.
3. jd_briefing_targeting_discipline: JD and briefing are targeting only; never JD-as-proof or briefing-as-proof.
4. role_fit_targeting: targeting may shape emphasis without becoming proof of experience.

Role-lane product shape:
- Bullet lanes: exactly 3 bullets (or expected bullet count matching role: Slalom 4, InsurTech 2, EY: 0 or consolidated), one high-impact thought per bullet, no embedded newline.
- Narrative lanes: exactly one sentence (or empty when consolidated), no more than {NARRATIVE_MAX_WORDS} words and {NARRATIVE_MAX_CHARS} characters.
- Source namespaces: Slalom uses bul_slalom_* source_fact_ids with reb_slalom_* graph bundle ids;
  InsurTech uses bul_insurtech_* source_fact_ids with reb_insurtech_* graph bundle ids;
  EY uses bul_ey_* source_fact_ids with reb_ey_* graph bundle ids.
- No first-person voice and no em dash in display text.

Decisive failure triggers:
- unsupported claim, missing source_fact_ids, or claim_ledger omission
- JD, briefing, or target company used as proof of experience
- wrong source namespace, cross-employer leakage, mixed graph evidence, or missing role source_fact_ids
- keyword stuffing, copied JD phrases, or ATS laundry-list phrasing
- wrong output shape: unexpected bullet count or multiple sentences for narrative lanes
