GRADE_ONLY_INSTRUCTION = """
You are grading a generated executive summary candidate produced by a separate generator.
judge_task: GRADE_ONLY

Mandatory rules:
- Do NOT write a new executive summary.
- Do NOT rewrite or edit the candidate text.
- Do NOT add claims, metrics, credentials, or facts.
- JD_TEXT and BRIEFING are targeting context only — never proof.
- Grade only against the rubric, allowed_fact_packet (graph proof pool), and candidate_output.
- **deterministic_gate_summary is authoritative for X2 gates.** If a gate shows `"pass": true`, you MUST NOT
  claim that gate failed or cite retired criteria (five-part S1–S5 arc, mandatory S5 credential sentence, etc.).
- **DISPLAY_OVERRIDE PARITY (CRITICAL):** When an `allowed_fact_packet` row carries a non-empty
  `display_override_text` field, treat the **UNION** of `claim_text` + `display_override_text` as the
  authorized fact substrate for that fact_id. The generator (PROVIDER_MODEL) is contractually required by X2 gate
  `x2_exec_summary_display_override_compliance` to emit the override text verbatim. Phrases drawn from
  `display_override_text` are **NOT unsupported extensions** and MUST NOT be cited as "extending beyond
  fact scope" or as inferential stretches. Grade fidelity to the union, not to `claim_text` alone.
- **GRAPH_PROOF_REFS (CRITICAL):** When a row carries `graph_proof_refs.claim_support_graph_refs`, grade
  `factual_support` against the UNION of `claim_text`, `display_override_text` (if any), and sentences that
  demonstrate skills listed in `claim_support_graph_refs`. Treat `graph_proof_refs.source_resume_files` as
  authoritative provenance for resume-backed skill claims — not as optional decoration.
- Return ONLY the required structured judge JSON schema (no markdown fences, no prose).

SRFS_GRADE_ONLY_RUBRIC = f"""
Rubric dimensions (SRFS executive summary — product shape **exactly 6 sentences**, one paragraph, max {EXEC_SUMMARY_MAX_WORDS} words):
1. factual_support: claims supported by allowed_fact_packet and candidate claim_ledger source_fact_ids.
2. executive_signal: SVP-level platform/governance/partner-motion synthesis, not bullet stacks.
3. resume_voice: credible third-person executive prose; penalize recruiter filler, "this individual", "Additionally/Furthermore" chains, generic AI-company prose, and anything that would fail a Head of Talent Acquisition screen.
4. ats_alignment_without_keyword_stuffing: JD shapes emphasis only; no JD-as-proof. When allowed facts
   lack EA/interop/federated proof IDs, penalize only if prose invents those themes or ignores documented
   gap_notes — not for absence alone when generation_law_digest requires gap_notes. Reward company-DNA specificity when the
   packet supports partner ecosystem, adoption motion, commercial fit, or a clean Head of Talent Acquisition screen.
5. anti_overfit: no unsupported metrics/credentials; no target company as candidate experience; no repeated metric inventory
   or company-name mirroring; no AI-authenticity dead giveaways such as em dashes, buzzword soup, or template phrasing.
6. synthesis_quality: **exactly six** integrated sentences with optional composition themes (identity, platform/governance,
   partner motion, adoption motion, outcomes, implied credibility). **Not** a fixed S1–S5 slot checklist. Fewer than six sentences
   is a decisive failure (aligned with x2_exec_summary_sentence_count_6). **Concise alone is insufficient** when
   evidence_utilization lists unused high-confidence facts, repeated metric surfaces recur across sentences, or prose reads as stacked bullets.
   Credential facts are **optional** — omit vendor cert inventories (AWS/Databricks/Associate-level labels); one FSA rigor weave is allowed
   when X2 passes (C0.3 phase-1, not a cert dump). Penalize AWS+FSA stacks or certification laundry lists. For SVP IT strategy targets,
   penalize metric-inventory S3–S5 and reward connective emphasis on enterprise architecture, partner ecosystems, adoption motion, and
   multi-year IT strategy (JD targeting only — never JD-as-proof). Sentence 6 must integrate the arc, not recap prior sentences thinly.
   Keep the cadence human enough to pass a Head of Talent Acquisition screen without machine-generated tells.
7. evidence_utilization: penalize under-use of allowed_fact_packet when unused_fact_ids is non-empty and synthesis is thin; reward
   distinct evidence themes instead of reusing the same proof surface repeatedly.
8. deterministic_alignment: **only** penalize gates that show `"pass": false` in deterministic_gate_summary.

Retired criteria (do NOT fail the candidate for these alone):
- Mandatory five-sentence arc or missing "S5 credibility sentence"
- S2 mechanism-only / S4 outcomes slot mandates from legacy SRFS shape gate
- Requiring Fellow of the Society of Actuaries or cert list in the paragraph

Decisive failure triggers (must be supported by allowed facts and deterministic_gate_summary failures when cited):
- unsupported business metric or credential in prose
- JD or briefing used as proof
- first-person narrative
- credential/certification inventory block (x2_exec_summary_no_credential_dump alignment)
- mechanism inventory in opening sentence or comma-chain architecture dump
- obvious rewrite recommendation that invents new claims

   substrate. Do not cite override phrases (e.g. "FSA-chartered", "informing data governance and AI
   strategy at scale") as anti_overfit violations.**
6. synthesis_quality: **exactly six** integrated sentences (X2 band); reward connective SVP IT strategy emphasis when
   ledger-backed; penalize thin recap S6, repeated metric surfaces, and bullet-stacked prose. **Do not** soft-penalize
   credential/metric inventory, unused_fact_ids weave targets, or mechanism dumps when the mapped deterministic gate shows `"pass": true`.
   Keep the cadence human enough to pass a Head of Talent Acquisition screen without machine-generated tells.
7. evidence_utilization: when `x2_exec_summary_evidence_utilization` is `"pass": true`, unused_fact_ids are optional weave
   targets — not proof gaps. Penalize under-use only when that gate is `"pass": false` or synthesis is decisively thin;
   reward distinct evidence themes instead of the same metric repeated in multiple sentences.
8. deterministic_alignment: **only** penalize gates that show `"pass": false` in deterministic_gate_summary. Never cite
   retired five-part/S1–S5 arc mandates when gates passed.

Residual quality (always in scope — not closed by X2 alone):
- executive clarity, narrative coherence, commercial fit, usefulness, unsupported phrasing outside ledger scope.

Decisive failure triggers (must align with deterministic_gate_summary failures when cited):
- unsupported business metric or credential (when x2 gates failed or decisive unsupported claim)
- JD or briefing used as proof
- first-person narrative
- obvious rewrite recommendation that invents new claims
