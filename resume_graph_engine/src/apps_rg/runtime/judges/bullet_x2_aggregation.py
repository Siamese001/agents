"""Code-based X2 aggregation for bullet sections (apps_rg-only; no apps_rg).

Per the section-orchestration redesign: after the deterministic hard validator (X2 gates) and the
ONE composite LLM judge run, a deterministic aggregation step combines them into a section-level
accept decision. This is the "X2 AGGREGATION" box in the design pattern:

    hard validator failure        -> reject (do not accept)
    judge decisive failure        -> reject
    valid + judge >= pass_floor   -> candidate-accept
    margin below margin_threshold -> mark "should adjudicate" (borderline)

This does NOT replace X3 disposition (which remains the single authority that emits the final
x3_code). It produces an advisory aggregation record that:
  * confirms the deterministic+judge agreement, and
  * flags borderline cases the adjudicator should escalate.

The aggregation is pure/deterministic and testable; the lane writes its output to
``bullet_x2_aggregation.json`` for evidence.
