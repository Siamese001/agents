"""Tests for x2_headline_xyz_literal_grounding (closes Bug:HeadlineXYZPhrasesNotGroundedInFactText).

Mirrors the Brown SVP failing case (full_resume_183cf9252e02 headline X3_BLOCK):
- RetiredProvider emitted ``SVP Engineering | Governed Agentic Platforms | Distributed AI Infrastructure | Enterprise Data Lineage``
- claim_ledger correctly cited fact_engineering_platform_005, fact_quant_hpc_002, fact_engineering_platform_004
- But the X/Y/Z phrases share ZERO content nouns with the cited facts' literal claim_text
- OpenAI judge: ``Unsupported: Governed Agentic Platforms`` (2.0 decisive)
- Claude judge: ``HPC trading platform latency \u2014 not the same as distributed AI infrastructure`` (3.2 soft)

This gate enforces the lexical grounding the X1D rubric was already implicitly checking,
catching the failure at the deterministic layer before the X1D judges get involved.
